# gatsby-react-router-scroll

React Router scroll management forked from
https://github.com/ytase/react-router-scroll for Gatsby which itself was forked
to upgrade to RR v4 from Jimmy Jia's original scroll management library for React
Router 2/3.

This has been modified now to be compatible with `@reach/router`.
