# Gatsby Recipes MDX Source

These are the MDX files for the official Recipes. [Please contribute!](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/how-to-contribute/) We welcome PRs for new recipes and fixes/improvements to existing recipes.

When you add a new recipe, please also add it to the recipes list at https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/05151c006974b7636b00f0cd608fac89ddaa1c08/packages/gatsby-recipes/src/cli.js#L60

Note: GitHub doesn't yet support viewing MDX files. In order to view a recipe in the GitHub UI you'll want to click into the recipe file and click on the "Raw" button.
