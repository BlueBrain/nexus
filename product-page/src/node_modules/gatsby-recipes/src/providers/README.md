create/update/destroy â€” call `read` and return it

## How to test

maybe create a helper function for setting up tests

- pass object for new object
  - validate it
  - plan for it
  - create it
  - read it
  - update it (another bit of info passed in
  - delete it

// Validate at each step that the response matches the schema + has required id field
