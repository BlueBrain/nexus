Gatsby is a modern framework for blazing fast websites.

- **Go Beyond Static Websites.** Get all the benefits of static websites with none of the
  limitations. Gatsby sites are fully functional React apps, so you can create high-quality,
  dynamic web apps, from blogs to e-commerce sites to user dashboards.

- **Use a Modern Stack for Every Site.** No matter where the data comes from, Gatsby sites are
  built using React and GraphQL. Build a uniform workflow for you and your team, regardless of
  whether the data is coming from the same backend.

- **Load Data From Anywhere.** Gatsby pulls in data from any data source, whether it’s Markdown
  files, a headless CMS like Contentful or WordPress, or a REST or GraphQL API. Use source plugins
  to load your data, then develop using Gatsby’s uniform GraphQL interface.

- **Performance Is Baked In.** Ace your performance audits by default. Gatsby automates code
  splitting, image optimization, inlining critical styles, lazy-loading and prefetching resources,
  and more to ensure your site is fast — no manual tuning required.

- **Host at Scale for Pennies.** Gatsby sites don’t require servers, so you can host your entire
  site on a CDN for a fraction of the cost of a server-rendered site. Many Gatsby sites can be
  hosted entirely free on services like GitHub Pages and Netlify.

## 🚀 Get Up and Running in 5 Minutes

You can get a new Gatsby site up and running on your local dev environment in 5 minutes with these three steps:

1.  **Create a Gatsby site from a Gatsby starter.**

    Get your Gatsby blog set up in a single command:

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new my-blazing-fast-site
    ```

2.  **Start the site in `develop` mode.**

    Next, move into your new site’s directory and start it up:

    ```shell
    cd my-blazing-fast-site/
    npm run develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`. Open the `my-blazing-fast-site` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

At this point, you’ve got a fully functional Gatsby website. For additional information on how you can customize your Gatsby site, see our [plugins](https://gatsbyjs.org/plugins/) and [the official tutorial](https://gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://gatsbyjs.org/).

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples head [to our documentation](https://gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the “Guides”, API reference, and “Advanced Tutorials” sections in the sidebar.

We welcome suggestions for improving our docs. See the [“how to contribute”](https://gatsbyjs.org/contributing/how-to-contribute/) documentation for more details.
