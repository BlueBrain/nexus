/**
 * Welcome to @reach/alert!
 *
 * An alert is an element that displays a brief, important message in a way that
 * attracts the user's attention without interrupting the user's task.
 * Dynamically rendered alerts are automatically announced by most screen
 * readers, and in some operating systems, they may trigger an alert sound.
 *
 * The approach here is to allow developers to render a visual <Alert> and then
 * we mirror that to a couple of aria-live regions behind the scenes. This way,
 * most of the time, developers don't have to think about visual vs. aria
 * alerts.
 *
 * Limitations: Developers can't read from context inside of an Alert because
 * we aren't using ReactDOM.createPortal(), we're actually creating a couple of
 * brand new React roots. We could use createPortal but then apps would need to
 * render the entire app tree in an <AlertProvider>, or maybe there's a way
 * with default context to do it, but we haven't explored that yet. So, we'll
 * see how this goes. If it becomes a problem we can introduce a portal later.
