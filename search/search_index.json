The links between the entities contain knowledge, based on how they connect to each other. For example, an apple can be connected to a tree (to show that it grows on trees) or in another case connected to a pie recipe (to show that it is part of a recipe). It is a formalized knowledge that enables programmatical reasoning about concepts in the world around us.\nIn this introduction to knowledge graphs the authors conclude that there is no clear definition of what a knowledge graph is. The term itself was coined in 2012 by Google as they introduced their Knowledge Graph as a mean of finding more relevant related search results by linking connected data on the web. As an idea, knowledge graphs are similar to semantic networks which date back to the 60’s and 70’s. The difference mainly lies in the size of the network, with knowledge graphs being larger. Knowledge graphs are also often generated in a rather manual way (data ingestion, data cleaning) instead of being generated and governed by a set of strict logical rules.\nFor a further introduction to knowledge graphs the “What is a knowledge graph” video from the CS520 Stanford course is a good resource.","title":"What is a knowledge graph?"},{"location":"/docs/getting-started/understanding-knowledge-graphs.html#the-graph-structure","text":"A knowledge graph consists of entities (nodes) that are connected to each other with relations (edges).\nThe entity is an object with properties that describe it. For example, a person, a company, an event, a thing… These properties can be called the entity’s “metadata”.\nThe relation describes how entities are connected. For example, being member of, visiting a place, belonging to a country…\nIt’s worth noting that having this graph data structure makes it easy to add new data into an existing graph by connecting new entities and new relations.","title":"The graph structure"},{"location":"/docs/getting-started/understanding-knowledge-graphs.html#describing-knowledge-in-a-graph","text":"After deciding what concept or idea that we wish to model in a knowledge graph, we need to collect the metadata that describes our entities. In order to make our data interoperable with other data and to allow us to import data from existing sources we should use a shared language when describing entities and relations. This is achieved using an ontology.\nThe ontology is a kind of dictionary containing types that can be used to describe entities. The metadata is created by picking a type from the ontology that matches what you wish to describe and defining the properties of the chosen type. E.g. a person can be described by a Person type. The name of the person can be encoded in a givenName property. This results in a set of data that can be processed both by humans and computers (as it is structured).\nFor example, in the image below, you can see that the entity Toy Story with a property Release date that has the value March 29th, 1995 and the Director property with the value John Lasseter.","title":"Describing knowledge in a graph"},{"location":"/docs/getting-started/understanding-knowledge-graphs.html#inferring-new-data-from-existing-relationships","text":"Since the entities are encoded using well-defined ontologies it allows us to draw conclusions based on the data we have and create new inferred data. This is done by giving the knowledge graph to an inference engine that can apply a set of logical rules to the data to derive new information. For example, if we have a knowledge graph containing persons and their birth year we could create an inference engine with rules that determine whether a person is a child or a retired person.\nIn the second example below, we have Toy Story, it has characters (using the relation called Character) and we have asserted the cast of characters. Having defined this, we can now define a rule that instructs the inference engine to create new relations Voice Cast whenever we find the Cast of a Character. This enables us to query the graph and directly get Toy Story’s voices cast without having to navigate through its Cast first.\nIn reality inferring knowledge is a complex topic. This video lecture shows some real-world examples of algorithms and rules for inference engines. E.g. reasoning about a persons creditworthiness based on what their home address is or trying to spot fake papers that have been submitted to a journal.","title":"Inferring new data from existing relationships"},{"location":"/docs/getting-started/understanding-knowledge-graphs.html#growing-a-knowledge-graph","text":"A graph is a flexible data structure, and an ontology can evolve as new data comes in. As a result, data can continually be added to help serve new use cases.\nThe illustration below shows how the initial graph representing Toy Story can be augmented to capture many other related domains such as:\nToy Story’s similar movies (e.g. Cars) Cities and associations related to motion picture production (e.g. Motion Picture Association of America) Places and people connected to animation movies (e.g. Steve Jobs)","title":"Growing a knowledge graph"},{"location":"/docs/getting-started/understanding-knowledge-graphs.html#encoding-knowledge-graphs-rdf-json-ld-and-other-standards","text":"","title":"Encoding knowledge graphs: RDF, JSON-LD, and other standards"},{"location":"/docs/getting-started/understanding-knowledge-graphs.html#rdf","text":"How do you encode knowledge graphs in a way that is interoperable with other applications and can be integrated with other data sources? You use some common formalism, a language, to describe your entities and relationships. For knowledge graphs this format is RDF. RDF (Resource Description Framework) is a data format where every piece of knowledge can be broken down into a structure (subject, predicate and object) called triple.\nRDF-formatted data can be queried using a query language such as SPARQL. This allows us to create applications that can process knowledge graphs, for example, to infer new data or get answers to questions we may have for the data that is stored in the knowledge graph.","title":"RDF"},{"location":"/docs/getting-started/understanding-knowledge-graphs.html#json-ld","text":"RDF is however only a part of what we need in order to encode a graph. We also need an implementation, a “concrete RDF syntax” that shows how to write down an RDF-formatted graph in a format that can be shared e.g. between applications. One syntax that can be used is JSON-LD. It stands for JSON for Linking Data.\nWe start by looking at a simple JSON example:\n[\n  \t{\n            \"title\":\"Floating island\",\n            \"author\":\"Unknown\"\n  \t},\n  \t{\n            \"title\":\"Apple balloon\",\n            \"author\":\"Grant Achatz\"\n  \t},\n  \t{\n            \"title\":\"Opera\",\n            \"author\":\"Cyriaque Gavillon\"\n  \t}\n\n  ]\nAfter reading the above JSON we can ask ourselves what this data describes? If we don’t recognise the names we may think these perhaps are titles of books or movies. There is clearly a lack of context resulting in an ambiguity. JSON-LD allows to solve the ambiguity problem by enabling a semantic-preserving data encoding. This is achieved by adding an @context object where every key is associated with an identifier.\nIf we extend the JSON example with the payload below, then both a machine and a human can look up the context to find out that the JSON refers to recipes. I.e. Floating island, Apple balloon and Opera.\n[\n  \t{\n            \"@context\":\"https://json-ld.org/contexts/recipe.jsonld\",\n            \"title\":\"Floating island\",\n            \"author\":\"Unknown\"\n  \t},\n  \t{\n            \"@context\":\"https://json-ld.org/contexts/recipe.jsonld\",\n            \"title\":\"Apple balloon\",\n            \"author\":\"Grant Achatz\"\n  \t},\n  \t{\n            \"@context\":\"https://json-ld.org/contexts/recipe.jsonld\",\n            \"title\":\"Opera\",\n            \"author\":\"Cyriaque Gavillon\"\n  \t }\n\n  ]\nIn the JSON-LD playground you can try examples of JSON-LD.","title":"JSON-LD"},{"location":"/docs/getting-started/understanding-knowledge-graphs.html#using-schema-org-as-a-common-vocabulary","text":"Having defined a grammar (RDF) and a concrete syntax (JSON-LD) to encode knowledge graphs, there is one more thing to add in order to achieve interoperability with other knowledge graphs. We need a common vocabulary that defines which properties an entity should have - an ontology.\nOne such ontology that is commonly used is the Schema.org vocabulary. You can look up how different concepts are described by searching for them on the schema.org web page. For example, a video game entity is described by properties such as cheatCode or gamePlatform.","title":"Using Schema.org as a common vocabulary"},{"location":"/docs/getting-started/understanding-knowledge-graphs.html#reasoning-with-owl","text":"If you wish to reason about knowledge that is stored in a knowledge graph it is useful to have a language that can express properties and relations for the entities in the ontology (the dictionary) that your knowledge graph consists of.

The advantages for deploying clusters are generally higher availability, capacity and throughput at the cost of higher latency, consistency and having to potentially deal with network instability.\nThe decision to go with single node deployments or clustered deployments can be revisited later on and mixed setups (some services single node while others clustered) are also possible.\nThe Nexus distribution is made up of docker images which can be run on any host operating system and each of the “off the shelf” products also offer docker as a deployment option. We would generally recommend using a container orchestration solution like Kubernetes, OpenShift or Docker Swarm as they offer good management capabilities, discovery, load balancing and self-healing.

When the usage profiles are unknown a couple of rules of thumb should narrow the scope:\nNexus uses a collection of data stores (Cassandra, ElasticSearch, BlazeGraph) which depend performance wise to the underlying disk access, so: prefer local storage over network storage for lower latency when doing IO, prefer SSD over HDDs because random access speed is more important than sequential access, one exception is the file storage (file resources which are stored as binary blobs on the filesystem) where the network disks should not be a cause for concern, nor random access speed; this assumes that accessing attachments is not the at the top in the usage profile All of Nexus services and most of the “off the shelf” products are built to run on top of the JVM which usually require more memory over computing power. A rough ratio of 2 CPU cores per 8GB of RAM is probably a good one (this of course depends on the CPU specification). Due to the design for scalability of Nexus services and “off the shelf” products the network is a very important characteristic of the deployment as frequent dropped packets or network partitions can seriously affect the availability of the system. Clustered / distributed systems generally use some form of consensus){ open=new } which is significantly affected by the reliability of the network. If the reliability of the network is a concern within the target deployment then vertical scalability is desirable over horizontal scalability: fewer host nodes with better specifications is better over more commodity hardware host nodes.","title":"Choice of hardware"},{"location":"/docs/getting-started/running-nexus/index.html#cassandra","text":"Nexus uses Cassandra as its primary store as it scales well in terms of reads with the number of nodes in the cluster.

All of the data that Nexus uses in other stores can be recomputed from the one stored in Cassandra as the other stores are used as mere indexing systems.\nPlease have a look at the Planning and Testing section in the DataStax documentation as it contains recommendations in terms of hardware and capacity.\nAs described in the architecture section the generally adopted persistence model is an EventSourced model in which the data store is used as an append only store.

Introduced configurable storage backends for files with local, remote and S3 implementations. ElasticSearchView | AggregateElasticSearchView have been promoted to stable. Introduced a new SPARQL view, AggregateSparqlView, that dispatches SPARQL queries to the appropriate namespaces and aggregates the results. ElasticSearchView and SparqlView support additional configuration options: resourceSchemas, resourceTypes, resourceTag, includeDeprecated, includeMetadata. API improvements: Support for additional filtering criteria when listing resources via query params: rev, deprecated, createdBy, updatedBy. The organization and project segments when exercising the API now accept their unique ids (UUID). Content negotiation for resources, supporting: dot, ntriples, json-ld expanded and compacted formats. Ability to resolve resource ids via configured project resolvers. Pagination of resources over 10,000 using the ’‘_next’’ link in the listing response. Resource metadata includes ’‘_incoming’‘ and ’‘_outgoing’’ links and the API now includes their respective endpoints. View indexing progress as a ‘‘statistics’’ sub-resource of each view. Nexus Web improvements: Better OpenIdConnect integration, ability to authenticate to multiple configured realms. Ability to discriminate between Nexus specific resources and user managed resources. Display the current ACLs and their source for the logged in user. Ability to query user defined views. Display the indexing progress for the active view. Exposed view indexing progress metrics for Prometheus.

Some changes introduced might have breaking consequences on clients consuming the Nexus Delta API if, and only if, your client does not already use a JSON-LD aware library\nJSON-LD has been our primary representation format since the beginnings of Nexus Delta. It is a powerful format that allows clients to use simple JSON while it adds support for Linked Data, opening the door to work with knowledge graphs.\nOur previous JSON-LD support was, in some cases, inconsistent with the specification. We have fixed that, introducing the following changes:\nAn @base defined on a remote context (a context that is specified as a link) does not have any effect on the resource payload. When an @base is not present in the @context section of the payload, the base field defined on resources’ project is used. When having an array of remote contexts, resolution is performed sequentially, overriding definitions when necessary. A default @context gets added to the payload only when the client didn’t provide it and the payload doesn’t contain any JSON-LD aware content (the payload is not able to produce some triples). When fetching a resource using the query parameter ?format=expanded, a fully expanded JSON-LD document is returned, instead of the hybrid JSON-LD response used in the previous versions.\nIn terms of new features related to JSON-LD, we are happy to announce that we now support:\nThe use of @graph in order to produce named graphs.

Decreasing the value of the JVM property akka.persistence.cassandra.events-by-tag.max-message-batch-size and akka.persistence.cassandra.journal.max-message-batch-size to 1 can also help mitigate the issue.

It does that by supporting customizable managed indices of the data (represented by View resources).\nPrior to this release, two main type of indices were made available ( ElasticSearchView and SparqlView) and their Aggregated* variants (for querying multiple indices at the same time). They enable fantastic search capabilities on the managed data. But while these types of indices are very powerful on their own, we found that bringing them closer together can raise the bar even further by taking advantage of their best use: an RDF graph is very powerful for data integration and exploration, while ElasticSearch is very powerful for full text and faceted search.\nThis release introduces a new type of managed index (represented by CompositeView resources) that allows the use of these indices together at their best. It allows integrating data from multiple sources (projects) in a single RDF graph to perform queries that generate documents to be stored in one or many ElasticSearch indices. The approach is extremely flexible as it allows the use of semantic web technologies to integrate, transform and filter data (via queries) to produce arbitrary document structures in ElasticSearch. (Sparql CONSTRUCT) queries can span across graphs of multiple resources removing the coupling on the data shapes for management vs search.\nAdditionally, the new views support sources of different (remote) Nexus projects introducing the first of many federation features. This first iteration allows collecting data from different Nexus deployments to produce local indices that enable fast local searches. For the best search user experience, data needs to be pre-indexed such that responses are delivered with minimal latency (distributed joins are significantly slower that local ones). The incremental indexing approach promoted by the system allows for near instant data synchronization between the sources and the local indices.\nFor more details on CompositeViews, please read below.","title":"Data Aggregation, Transformation and Projection"},{"location":"/docs/releases/v1.3-release-notes.html#details","text":"","title":"Details"},{"location":"/docs/releases/v1.3-release-notes.html#compositeviews","text":"CompositeViews are yet another type of view introduced (currently in Beta) to enable new indexing capabilities:\nability to collect data to be indexed from multiple sources (current project, other projects, remote Nexus deployments); ability to apply transformations to the indexed data by means of SPARQL CONSTRUCT queries that are executed on the entire RDF graph generated from all data sources; ability to project data to multiple indices; ability to query multiple projections of the same type; ability to query the entire RDF graph generated from all data sources.\nThe name stems from its unique characteristic of aggregating data from multiple sources and managing multiple projections.\nA CompositeView can define several sources of data of different types:\nProjectEventStream: the event log of the project where the CompositeView is defined CrossProjectEventStream: the event log of an arbitrary project within the same Nexus deployment RemoteProjectEventStream: the event log of an arbitrary project within a different Nexus deployment\nThe sources are consumed as a collection of event streams, either from the primary store or via Server Sent Events in the case of the RemoteProjectEventStream. Each event is either exchanged with the resource for which it was emitted or dropped (if the filters defined in the originating source exclude it). The resource is then transformed into an RDF graph and stored in a temporary namespace of BlazeGraph.\nProjections are then executed by querying the temporary namespace via the SPARQL CONSTRUCT queries defined as part of their configuration. These queries allow constructing an arbitrary RDF graph by traversing the temporary one starting from the IRI node representing the originating resource id (the system recognizes the {resource_id} token in the provided query and replaces it with the corresponding value).\nCompositeViews allow defining multiple projections; the current supported types are:\nElasticSearchProjection: data is projected as documents in an ElasticSearch index SparqlProjection: data is projected as an RDF named graph in a BlazeGraph namespace\nProjections include filtering configuration to allow resources of different types or constrained by different schemas to be indexed separately. An obvious use case is to index resources of different shapes in different ElasticSearch indices with appropriate mapping definitions for each variation.\nThe complete configuration options can be found in the api reference.","title":"CompositeViews"},{"location":"/docs/releases/v1.3-release-notes.html#view-offsets","text":"Views now expose offset as a sub-resource allowing the retrieval of the last consumed event id.

We move on from this monolithic approach towards a multi scoped system, where data is bucketed and managed independently in projects.\nWhat we previously referred to as domains are now called projects and represent data and configuration boundaries within the system (we decided to change the naming as we have found that the term “domain” was understood to imply a certain data organization scheme centered around business or scientific domains; this was not intended).\nIntroducing these boundaries has opened the door to make several performance and functional improvements to the system as follows:\ndata indexing can now be configured at the project level without impacting the overall system; we’ve introduced a new resource type View that controls how and where the data is being indexed. They can be managed at runtime by the clients with “administrative” privileges enabling the development of applications specific to the area of interest. An example of that is the BBP Nexus Search application designed specifically to address the needs of the BlueBrain Project. indexing processes are now created for each individual project increasing the indexing throughput and allowing the use of distinct indexing targets. the uniqueness of a resource within the system was determined by the resource id which comprised of the “organization”, “domain”, “schema” name and version and the resource id. Introducing these data boundaries allowed us to relax this constraint and allow multiple resources to share the same id if they are scoped in different projects. access control lists are now restricted to either root (/), organization (/{org}) or project (/{org}/{project}) removing the need to index these definitions along with the data.","title":"Isolated data scopes"},{"location":"/docs/releases/v1.0-release-notes.html#client-defined-identifiers","text":"The v0.y.z series was very opinionated on how resource ids are defined and prohibited client provided identifiers. The choice at the time was that a resource id needs to be resolvable (the resource id needed to match the url to access it). This strong constraint tied the resource ids to the Nexus deployment where they were managed. While this was probably fine for most data within the system, it was nearly impossible to manage data from external sources that came with its own identification scheme (e.g. ontologies).\nThe decision was made to remove this constraint and allow clients to specify their own identifiers. In order to maintain the same API simplicity with respect to accessing resources we came up with a aliasing and curie scheme configurable at the project level (_apiMappings_) that handles bidirectional compaction and expansion of resource identifiers.\nA simple http proxying configuration with URL rewriting deployed in front of the Nexus API allows resources to continue to be resolvable.","title":"Client defined identifiers"},{"location":"/docs/releases/v1.0-release-notes.html#resolution-mechanisms-for-shared-resources","text":"During the past year of production use of Nexus we have noticed that users tend to develop schemas and contexts as reusable components. An example of that is the Neuroshapes initiative, a community effort for a shared vocabulary and collection of constraints for neuroscience.\nThe use of schemas and contexts in the v0.y.z series applied a restriction on the locality of constrained resources, specifically resources could only be created in the same domain with schemas.\nIn the new iteration we’ve introduced a configurable resolution mechanism that allows users to make use of schemas and contexts that reside in other projects. The resources that control this behaviour are called Resolvers and they behave like dependency management systems in programming language ecosystems.\nResolvers can now be created and configured to look up schemas and contexts in arbitrary locations, scoped within projects. The resolution mechanism takes into account all the resolvers defined in a project using the priorities of each resolver and attempts to resolve the referenced resource based on its @id value. Current supported resolvers are:\nInProject: a default project resource created along with a project that looks up referenced resources in the same project. CrossProject: a type of resolver that can be created by clients to look up referenced resources in projects other than the current one.\nFuture developments will include additional resolver types that are capable of resolving resources in other Nexus deployments or shared repositories (e.g.: a git repository).\nSchema imports through the owl:imports clause works recursively as before, but it applies the resolution mechanism at each iteration. Context references work recursively as before applying the resolution mechanism at each iteration.\nNote: Contexts are no longer handled differently, as special kind of resources. Any resource id can be used as a context reference; the system will resolve the referenced resource and apply only the @context value from its representation to the resource that references it.","title":"Resolution mechanisms for shared resources"},{"location":"/docs/releases/v1.0-release-notes.html#improved-handling-of-binary-resources","text":"The v0.y.z series handled binary resources as sub-resources, called attachments, following the model pioneered by CouchDB. While it provided a guarantee that every binary resource is properly described with metadata, the model did not work well in the following situations:\nuploading binaries for later organization: the parent resource required creation before a binary could be attached to it, which in the cases where users were just interested in storing binaries in Nexus it required two API calls instead of one. conflicting vocabulary definitions: a lot of the data modeling effort relied on the Nexus metadata for the uploaded binaries which forced the use of a certain vocabulary and metadata structure in Nexus\nThis model of handling binaries has been superseded by full class support for binaries through files, a new kind of resource managed just like the other types of resources within the system. Files have their own lifecycle and can be independently updated. Description of files, for example in the case of datasets, can now be done external to the file resource within a separate resource. This model allows for many-to-many relationships between files and other resources.","title":"Improved handling of binary resources"},{"location":"/docs/releases/v1.0-release-notes.html#new-mechanism-for-stable-resource-references","text":"The v0.y.z series was quite opinionated on the use of stable references ensuring the structural and semantic immutability of a resource revision. Schemas and Contexts had to be published before they could be used and once published their lifecycle would finish, preventing further updates.\nThis behaviour was replaced by giving the client the control on the immutability guarantees through the use of revisions and tags. The schema versions are no longer present in the API and the mechanism for unpacking schema references are aware of possible tag and revision references provided as query parameters. A tag is a new type of sub-resource that represents a pointer to a resource revision.\nAssuming the following entry in the project apiMappings:\n{\n  \"prefix\": \"persons\",\n  \"namespace\": \"http://nexus.example.com/schemas/person?tag=v1.0.0\"\n}\n… would ensure that resources are constrained with a stable version of a schema:\ncurl -XPOST http://nexus.example.com/resources/{org}/{proj}/persons -d '{}'\nAdditionally, the use of curies is also available, leaving the door open to providing schema versions per resource. Considering the following entry in the project apiMappings:\n{\n  \"prefix\": \"persons\",\n  \"namespace\": \"http://nexus.example.com/schemas/person?tag=\"\n}\n… resources can be constrained with a dynamic version of a schema provided at the time of resource creation:\ncurl -XPOST http://nexus.example.com/resources/{org}/{proj}/persons:v1.0.0 -d '{}'\nRevision query params can be used in the exact same manner as tag params. When omitting rev or tag query params when referring to schema, it is implied that the latest version should be used every time that schema is resolved.\nContext references follow the very same behaviour. Context iri values can be augmented with a tag or rev query parameter to point to a specific immutable reference of the resource.\nNote: the behaviour depends on the new resource reference resolution process; a change in the resolver resources (a different resolution process configuration) can not provide an immutability guarantee of the references.","title":"New mechanism for stable resource references"},{"location":"/docs/releases/v1.0-release-notes.html#client-configurable-indexing-process","text":"As mentioned previously, the indexing processes are now applied at the level of each project and can be customized by the client.

AggregateElasticSearchView: this view does not directly manage an indexing process, but rather represents a collection of referenced _ElasticSearchView_s that would be proxied (queried at the same time) when querying this view. SparqlView: the process replays the project event log applies minimal data transformation and updates an RDF store (currently BlazeGraph).\nA default ElasticSearchView and a default SparqlView are automatically created along with a project. The default ElasticSearchView is used by Nexus internally to power resource listing.\nSince access control lists are now limited to nesting up to the level of a project, these views do not require indexing the acl configuration and can be proxied by the system supporting their native APIs.\n_ElasticSearchView_s expose a /_search sub-resource that represents the native API for interacting with ElasticSearch.

Intent to change the application state is represented by commands that are validated for access and consistency before being evaluated. Successful evaluations of commands emit events that are persisted to the global event log.\nAsynchronous processes (projections) replay the event log and process the information for efficient consumption. The information in the recorded events is transformed into documents (in the case of ElasticSearch) and named graphs (in the case of BlazeGraph) and persisted in the respective stores. The projections persist their progress such that they can be resumed in case of a crash.\nSources of events for projections are both the primary store and other (remote) Nexus Delta deployments through the Server Sent Events W3C recommendation. This allows for data aggregation when building indices.\nNative interfaces are offered as part of the read (query) model for querying ElasticSearch and BlazeGraph.\nAsynchronous indexing (projections) and the separation between reads and writes have some interesting consequences:\nthe system is eventually consistent and does not require a healing mechanism for handling synchronization errors the primary store acts as a bulkhead in case of arbitrary data ingestion spikes the primary store and the stores used for indices can be independently sized; indexing speed is allowed to vary based on the performance of each store the system continues to function with partial degradation instead of becoming unavailable if a store suffers downtime\nApache Cassandra is used as an eventsourced primary store and represents the source of truth for all the information in the system. Updates are not performed in place, state changes are appended to the event log.

Imagine the following scenario:\nEach block is identified by a path that contains a list of permissions for a certain identity (identities are color code divided).\nThere is a special set of permissions which restrict the use of the ACLs API:\nacls/read - an auth. token containing an identity with this permission is allowed to fetch a collection of ACL from any other identity. acls/write - an auth. token containing an identity with this permission is allowed to perform the call to the following endpoints: create ACLs, replace ACLs, subtract ACLs, append ACLs and delete ACLs.\nThose permissions need to be present in the current {path} where the API interaction occurs or in any parent path. In other words, they are inherited.\nLet’s clarify this concept with an example from the previous diagram. identity 1 could call the create ACLs endpoint on any {path} while identity 2 could only call the same endpoint for any path child of /myorg (like /myorg/myproj).

These cover a wide range of requirements but may not suffice in certain cases. New indexing capabilities can be added using external processes that subscribe to the global event log, enrich the information and project the result in arbitrary stores.\nBy exposing over HTTP(S) the event log using the Server-Sent Events W3C recommendation, Blue Brain Nexus allows clients to replicate the internal streaming approach, and the push based asynchronous service communication for resource projections.\nAn example of such a tool is the newly introduced docker image (bluebrain/nexus-cli) that supports projecting data to InfluxDB and PostgreSQL databases. The image is yet another software artifact in the Blue Brain Nexus ecosystem that complements the system to introduce new indexing capabilities that are not part of the core.\nIt functions as described above following a simple streaming approach with the following stages:\nsubscribe to the global event log of the KG service for each individual event (change in the system) collect additional information about the change and the current state of the resource; the information is collected by querying the Sparql view defined in the project where the change occurred the collected information is projected to a target system (InfluxDB or PostgreSQL) by performing an insert or update\nThe sections below describe how each of the newly supported projections work and how one would configure them.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"/docs/utilities/projections.html#projecting-data-into-influxdb","text":"In order to compute statistics about various kinds of data hosted in Blue Brain Nexus, like volume over time, a time series database like InfluxDB is a very good solution.\nThe following example shows how one could use the bluebrain/nexus-cli docker image, InfluxDB and Grafana to continuously compute statistics about data evolution in each project in Blue Brain Nexus.\nTo start, let’s set up an influxdb docker container running in the background:\ndocker run -p 8086:8086 -d -e INFLUXDB_DATA_MAX_VALUES_PER_TAG=0 --name influx influxdb:1.8.0\nThe additional environment variable INFLUXDB_DATA_MAX_VALUES_PER_TAG disables the limit of maximum tag values for measurements.\nWe can now configure the projection using two config files (env.conf and influx.conf in the HOCON format) that will be mounted to the nexus-cli container:\nmkdir config\n\necho '\nenv {\n  endpoint = ${NEXUS_ENDPOINT}\n  token = ${NEXUS_TOKEN}\n  http-client {\n    retry {\n      strategy = \"exponential\"\n      initial-delay = 100 millis\n      max-delay = 20 seconds\n      max-retries = 10\n      condition = \"on-server-error\"\n    }\n  }\n  default-sparql-view = \"https://bluebrain.github.io/nexus/vocabulary/defaultSparqlIndex\"\n}\n' > config/env.conf\n\necho '\ninflux {\n  endpoint = ${NEXUS_INFLUXDB_ENDPOINT}\n  database = ${NEXUS_INFLUXDB_DATABASE}\n  db-creation-command = \"\"\"CREATE DATABASE \"\"\"\"${influx.database}\"\"\"\" WITH DURATION 10000d REPLICATION 1 SHARD DURATION 7d NAME \"\"\"\"${influx.database}\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n  offset-file = ${NEXUS_INFLUXDB_OFFSET_FILE}\n  offset-save-interval = 5 minutes\n  default-sparql-query = \"\"\"\n    PREFIX ns:<https://neuroshapes.org/>\n    PREFIX schema:<http://schema.org/>\n    PREFIX nxv:<https://bluebrain.github.io/nexus/vocabulary/>\n\n    SELECT ?project ?type ?created ?deprecated ?bytes WHERE {\n      <{resource_id}>       nxv:createdAt            ?created .\n      <{resource_id}>      nxv:deprecated         ?deprecated .\n      OPTIONAL {\n        <{resource_id}> schema:distribution                  ?d .\n        ?d                                a schema:DataDownload .\n        ?d               schema:contentSize                 ?cs .\n        ?cs                    schema:value         ?bytesValue .\n      }\n      BIND(\"{resource_project}\" AS ?project)\n      BIND(REPLACE(\"{resource_type}\", \"^.*/([^/]+)$\", \"$1\") AS ?type)\n      BIND(IF(BOUND(?bytesValue),?bytesValue,0) AS ?bytes)\n    }\n  \"\"\"\n  projects {\n    bbp/atlas {\n      types = [\n        {\n          type = ${nrs}\"BrainAtlasRelease\"\n          query = ${influx.default-sparql-query}\n          measurement = \"distribution\"\n          values = [\"bytes\"]\n          timestamp = \"created\"\n        },\n        {\n          type = ${nrs}\"BrainAtlasSpatialReferenceSystem\"\n          query = ${influx.default-sparql-query}\n          measurement = \"distribution\"\n          values = [\"bytes\"]\n          timestamp = \"created\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\nnrs = \"https://neuroshapes.org/\"\n' > config/influx.conf\nThe env.conf file defines a set of global properties that will be read from the process environment variables like for example the NEXUS_ENDPOINT or the NEXUS_TOKEN to be used for connecting to the system and how errors should be retried.\nThe influx.conf file defines how should the execution happen, what projects and types to consider, what queries to be executed for collecting information about each resource and where to project the result.\nIn this example we will consider that we’d like to index information about resources with the types https://neuroshapes.org/BrainAtlasRelease and https://neuroshapes.org/BrainAtlasSpatialReferenceSystem from the bbp/atlas project. The information that we would like to collect about each of these resources is defined in the variables selected in the SPARQL query, specifically:\n?project: the project where the resource is hosted (resources of the same type can be in multiple projects) ?type: the type that was used to configure the collection of information (resources may have multiple types, but we may only be interested in one) ?created: the timestamp when the resource was initially created ?deprecated: whether the resource was deprecated or not ?bytes: the number of bytes of the resource distribution\nFor each of the resources in the system that have the type defined in the configuration a new point will be created in the InfluxDB database using the ?created value as the timestamp, ?bytes as field with its value and the ?project, ?type and ?deprecated as tags.\nObviously some of the information we’re looking for is not necessarily present in the RDF graph, but we can obtain this information by means of templating. The SPARQL select query executed is first processed to replace some well known tokens (supported ones are: resource_id - the id of the resource for which the current change was recorded, resource_project - the project in which the change was recorded, resource_type - the type of the resource that matches the type entry in the configuration and event_rev - the revision of the resource that the current processed event has yielded). Information can thus be passed from the context of each event to the SPARQL select query. The BIND statements allow setting fixed or conditional values to the collected variable patterns:\nBIND(\"{resource_project}\" AS ?project) binds the project label (bbp/atlas in this case) to the ?project variable BIND(REPLACE(\"{resource_type}\", \"^.*/([^/]+)$\", \"$1\") AS ?type) binds the tail (curie name) to the ?type variable such that a type like https://neuroshapes.org/BrainAtlasRelease will be bound as BrainAtlasRelease to the ?type variable BIND(IF(BOUND(?bytesValue),?bytesValue,0) AS ?bytes) binds the value of the selected literal bytes value if it is found in the graph, or the value of 0 otherwise.\nSince the SPARQL query configuration supports templating, the queries can be very efficient. They can select triples with a well defined starting point (the resource id) which are simple for the triple store to handle due to optimal use of indices. Any Sparql query can be executed; the selected variables will be projected as either a timestamp, a field or a tag, depending on the configuration. If the query returns multiple rows only the first one will be considered.\nThe configuration also mentions a file (NEXUS_INFLUXDB_OFFSET_FILE) where the tool can save its progress such that it can resume from the last event processed in case of restarts.\nWe’re ready to start the tool:\ndocker run \\\n  -v $(pwd)/config:/home/nexus/.nexus \\\n  --link=influx \\\n  -e NEXUS_ENDPOINT=\"https://sandbox.bluebrainnexus.io/v1\" \\\n  -e NEXUS_TOKEN=\"******\" \\\n  -e NEXUS_INFLUXDB_ENDPOINT=\"http://influx:8086\" \\\n  -e NEXUS_INFLUXDB_DATABASE=\"nstats\" \\\n  -e NEXUS_INFLUXDB_OFFSET_FILE=\"/home/nexus/.nexus/influx.offset\" \\\n  bluebrain/nexus-cli:1.3.0 influxdb run\nThe tool will output something like the following (assuming the selected data exists in the system), and it’s going to continue to run, waiting for new changes. The tool uses a continuous subscription, so it will first replay the entire log until it reaches the end and then it’s going to wait for new changes to be recorded in the system.\nSLF4J: Failed to load class \"org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder\".\nSLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation\nSLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.\nStarting influxDB projection...\nRead 100 events (success: 0, skip: 100, errors: 0)\nRead 200 events (success: 0, skip: 200, errors: 0)\nRead 300 events (success: 0, skip: 300, errors: 0)\nRead 400 events (success: 0, skip: 400, errors: 0)\nRead 500 events (success: 0, skip: 500, errors: 0)\nRead 600 events (success: 0, skip: 600, errors: 0)\nRead 700 events (success: 0, skip: 700, errors: 0)\nRead 800 events (success: 0, skip: 800, errors: 0)\nRead 900 events (success: 0, skip: 900, errors: 0)\nRead 1000 events (success: 0, skip: 1000, errors: 0)\n...\nRead 2023400 events (success: 905059, skip: 1118341, errors: 0)\nProcessed 905100 events (success: 905100, errors: 0)\nRead 2023500 events (success: 905159, skip: 1118341, errors: 0)\nProcessed 905200 events (success: 905200, errors: 0)\nThe final step is to set up grafana to visualize the time series data recorded.\ndocker run -p 3000:3000 -d --link=influx --name grafana grafana/grafana:6.4.4\nAfter the grafana container starts successfully, we need to configure it to add the influxdb datasource and create a dashboard to visualize the data:\ncurl -XPOST -H\"Content-Type: application/json\" -s http://localhost:3000/api/datasources -u admin:admin -d '\n{\n  \"orgId\": 1,\n  \"name\": \"InfluxDB\",\n  \"type\": \"influxdb\",\n  \"typeLogoUrl\": \"\",\n  \"access\": \"proxy\",\n  \"url\": \"http://influx:8086\",\n  \"password\": \"\",\n  \"user\": \"\",\n  \"database\": \"nstats\",\n  \"basicAuth\": false,\n  \"basicAuthUser\": \"\",\n  \"basicAuthPassword\": \"\",\n  \"withCredentials\": false,\n  \"isDefault\": false,\n  \"jsonData\": {\n    \"httpMode\": \"GET\",\n    \"keepCookies\": [],\n    \"timeInterval\": \"1h\"\n  }\n}'\n\nwget https://bluebrainnexus.io/docs/additional-info/grafana-dashboard.json\n\ncurl -XPOST -H\"Content-Type: application/json\" -s http://localhost:3000/api/dashboards/db -d @grafana-dashboard.json\nThe last command should output something like:\n{\"id\":1,\"slug\":\"blue-brain-nexus-statistics\",\"status\":\"success\",\"uid\":\"CjzVq5RMk\",\"url\":\"/d/CjzVq5RMk/blue-brain-nexus-statistics\",\"version\":1}\nYou can now navigate to the grafana container to view the data at http://localhost:3000 (default username and password are admin:admin). Assuming the configuration matches the data in the Blue Brain Nexus deployment the board should look similar to the following:","title":"Projecting data into InfluxDB"},{"location":"/docs/utilities/projections.html#projecting-data-into-postgresql","text":"A lot of users prefer using a relational model with a fixed schema to query data in systems. They’re used to using SQL a query language and wouldn’t necessarily want to learn a new query language like SPARQL to navigate the graph. Additionally, there are a lot of analytics tools that support connecting to RDBMS systems and enable real time queries with strong visualization engines.\nIn order to address this use case we’ve built the bluebrain/nexus-cli docker image to be used for projecting data into a PostgreSQL database.\nThe following example shows how one could use the bluebrain/nexus-cli docker image to project a subset of an RDF graph to a strict relational model.

The information that we would like to collect about each of these resources is defined in the variables selected in the SPARQL queries, specifically for the schemas table we’ll collect:\n?id: the id of each schema ?rev: the last known revision of each schema ?project: the project where the schema resides\nFor the schema_imports table we’ll collect the import relationships:\n?id: the id of each schema ?import: the id of the schema that is imported by the one identified by ?id\nThe schema_imports table will contain multiple rows for a schema identified by ?id if it defines multiple imports.\nObviously some of the information we’re looking for is not necessarily present in the RDF graph, but we can obtain this information by means of templating. The SPARQL select query executed is first processed to replace some well known tokens (supported ones are: resource_id - the id of the resource for which the current change was recorded, resource_project - the project in which the change was recorded, resource_type - the type of the resource that matches the type entry in the configuration and event_rev - the revision of the resource that the current processed event has yielded). Information can thus be passed from the context of each event to the SPARQL select query. The BIND statements allow setting fixed or conditional values to the collected variable patterns, like for example: the BIND(\"{resource_project}\" AS ?project) binds the project label (tutorialnexus/datamodels in this case) to the ?project variable.\nSince the SPARQL query configuration supports templating, the queries can be very efficient. They can select triples with a well defined starting point (the resource id) which are simple for the triple store to handle due to optimal use of indices. Any Sparql query can be executed; the selected variables will be projected as either a timestamp, a field or a tag, depending on the configuration.\nThe configuration requires the definition of a DDL statement for each type selection. The following type mapping is currently supported by the tool:\nNode Type DB Type Iri Character types, such as: char, varchar and text Blank Node Character types, such as: char, varchar and text http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string Character types, such as: char, varchar and text http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#long Numeric types, such as int http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int Numeric types, such as int http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer Numeric types, such as int http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean Boolean http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime Timestamp\nThe configuration also mentions a file (NEXUS_POSTGRES_OFFSET_FILE) where the tool can save its progress such that it can resume from the last event processed in case of restarts.\nWe’re ready to start the tool:\ndocker run \\\n  -v $(pwd)/config:/home/nexus/.nexus \\\n  --link=postgres \\\n  -e NEXUS_ENDPOINT=\"https://sandbox.bluebrainnexus.io/v1\" \\\n  -e NEXUS_TOKEN=\"******\" \\\n  -e NEXUS_POSTGRES_HOST=\"postgres\" \\\n  -e NEXUS_POSTGRES_PORT=\"5432\" \\\n  -e NEXUS_POSTGRES_DATABASE=\"postgres\" \\\n  -e NEXUS_POSTGRES_USERNAME=\"postgres\" \\\n  -e NEXUS_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=\"postgres\" \\\n  -e NEXUS_POSTGRES_OFFSET_FILE=\"/home/nexus/.nexus/postgres.offset\" \\\n  bluebrain/nexus-cli:1.3.0 postgres run\nThe tool will output something like the following (assuming the selected data exists in the system), and it’s going to continue to run, waiting for new changes. The tool uses a continuous subscription, so it will first replay the entire log until it reaches the end and then it’s going to wait for new changes to be recorded in the system.\nSLF4J: Failed to load class \"org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder\".\nSLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation\nSLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.\nStarting influxDB projection...\nRead 100 events (success: 0, skip: 100, errors: 0)\nRead 200 events (success: 0, skip: 200, errors: 0)\nRead 300 events (success: 0, skip: 300, errors: 0)\nRead 400 events (success: 0, skip: 400, errors: 0)\nRead 500 events (success: 0, skip: 500, errors: 0)\nRead 600 events (success: 0, skip: 600, errors: 0)\nRead 700 events (success: 0, skip: 700, errors: 0)\nRead 800 events (success: 0, skip: 800, errors: 0)\nRead 900 events (success: 0, skip: 900, errors: 0)\nRead 1000 events (success: 0, skip: 1000, errors: 0)\n...\nRead 238000 events (success: 0, skip: 238000, errors: 0)\nRead 238100 events (success: 0, skip: 238100, errors: 0)\nRead 238200 events (success: 9, skip: 238191, errors: 0)\nProcessed 100 events (success: 100, errors: 0)\nRead 238300 events (success: 109, skip: 238191, errors: 0)\nRead 238400 events (success: 177, skip: 238223, errors: 0)\nRead 238500 events (success: 177, skip: 238323, errors: 0)\nWe can now query the data that has been projected to the PostgreSQL container.\nFirst we need to login:\ndocker exec -it postgres psql -U postgres\npsql (12.2 (Debian 12.2-2.pgdg100+1))\nType \"help\" for help.\n\npostgres=#\nCount the schemas:\npostgres=# select count(*) from schemas;\n count\n-------\n   176\n(1 row)\nFind the top 5 schemas with the most direct imports:\npostgres=# select id,count(import) from schema_imports group by id order by count desc limit 5;\n                          id                          | count\n------------------------------------------------------+-------\n https://neuroshapes.org/commons/entity               |     7\n https://neuroshapes.org/commons/minds                |     6\n https://neuroshapes.org/dash/density                 |     4\n https://neuroshapes.org/commons/experimentalprotocol |     4\n https://neuroshapes.org/dash/intrasharprecordedcell  |     4\n(5 rows)\nFind all transitive imports of a specific schema:\npostgres=# WITH RECURSIVE tree(schema, timport) AS (\n   SELECT\n      s.id,\n      s.import\n   FROM\n      schema_imports s\n   LEFT JOIN\n      schema_imports p ON s.import = p.id\n   WHERE\n      p.id IS NULL\n   UNION\n   SELECT\n      id,\n      timport\n   FROM\n      tree\n   INNER JOIN\n      schema_imports on tree.schema = schema_imports.import\n)\nSELECT * FROM tree where schema = 'https://neuroshapes.org/dash/intrasharprecordedcell';\n\n                       schema                        |                        timport\n-----------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------\n https://neuroshapes.org/dash/intrasharprecordedcell | https://neuroshapes.org/commons/labeledontologyentity\n https://neuroshapes.org/dash/intrasharprecordedcell | https://provshapes.org/commons/derivation\n https://neuroshapes.org/dash/intrasharprecordedcell | https://provshapes.org/commons/invalidation\n https://neuroshapes.org/dash/intrasharprecordedcell | https://provshapes.org/commons/generation\n https://neuroshapes.org/dash/intrasharprecordedcell | https://neuroshapes.org/commons/language\n https://neuroshapes.org/dash/intrasharprecordedcell | https://neuroshapes.org/commons/license\n https://neuroshapes.org/dash/intrasharprecordedcell | https://neuroshapes.org/commons/vector3d\n https://neuroshapes.org/dash/intrasharprecordedcell | https://neuroshapes.org/commons/propertyvalue\n(8 rows)","title":"Projecting data into PostgreSQL"},{"location":"/docs/utilities/nexus-python-cli.html","text":"","title":"MovieLens Tutorial using the Nexus Python CLI"},{"location":"/docs/utilities/nexus-python-cli.html#movielens-tutorial-using-the-nexus-python-cli","text":"","title":"MovieLens Tutorial using the Nexus Python CLI"},{"location":"/docs/utilities/nexus-python-cli.html#overview","text":"This example-driven tutorial presents 5 steps to get started with Blue Brain Nexus to build and query a simple knowledge graph.
