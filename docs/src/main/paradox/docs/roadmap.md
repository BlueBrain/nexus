# Roadmap

Check our @link:[GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus/milestones?direction=asc&sort=title&state=open){ open=new } for the latest updates and priorities for Nexus.

Note that the content of milestones is subject to change without notice (for example depending on sprint completion). 
We favor frequent releases, so we might remove some items of the milestone instead of extending the due date.

Our current release schedule is one milestone every two weeks approximately, resulting in the next patch, minor or major release.

The schedule might vary depending on urgency of patch releases, feature complexity, and time of year (among other things).

Please reach out to us on our @link:[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus/discussions){ open=new } page if you have questions.
