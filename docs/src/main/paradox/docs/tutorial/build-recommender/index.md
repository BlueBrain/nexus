# Building a Data Pipeline for a Recommender System

![recommendation](assets/recommendation.png)

## Overview
Recommendation engines are among the most well known, widely used and highest-value use cases for applying machine learning.
Despite this, while there are many resources available for the basics of training a recommendation model,
there are relatively few that explain how to use Nexus to build a data pipeline,
actually deploy these models to create a production-level machine learning eco-system for a recommender system.

## What you'll build
You will use a Jupyter notebook to build a pipeline to train a recommendation system.

## What you'll learn

* Set up a Nexus environment.
* Query the data from Nexus using SPARQL.
* Prepare the data into a good shape for collaborative filtering.
* Perform a classical collaborative filtering algorithm - matrix factorization
* Push the training output to Nexus
* Recommend movies by querying the output from Nexus

## What you'll need
A Python environment with support of Jupyter notebook
