## What you'll build

* A simple pipeline to query entities managed within Blue Brain Nexus, connect them with entities available on the web as structured data and extend and enrich their metadata.

## What you'll learn

* An understanding of linked data principles
* How to query data stored in a Nexus SparqlView.
* How to query structured data on the web.
* How to extend the metadata of entities managed within Blue Brain Nexus with external structured data on the web. We target [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) as an example.
* How to update entities within Blue Brain Nexus using the [SDK](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus-python-sdk) and enrich their metadata

## What you'll need
* A Python 3.5 or higher environment with support of Jupyter notebook
