# Getting Started

The Nexus ecosystem is a data catalog with several technologies and techniques used to get insight and explore the data within the ecosystem. 

One of the powerful ways to query data is through the Knowledge Graph built in Nexus. For that reason we encourage you to get familiar with these concepts reading @ref:[Understanding Knowledge Graphs](understanding-knowledge-graphs.md).

The next steps would be to either try Nexus using the @ref:[Sandbox](try-nexus.md) deployment or @ref:[run Nexus locally](running-nexus.md).
