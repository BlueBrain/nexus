# Nexus Fusion

Nexus Fusion is the web interface of Blue Brain Nexus, powered by @ref:[Nexus Delta](../delta/index.md). It offers 
prebuilt data visualization, querying, data manipulation, and administration capabilities to help integrate, edit and 
visualize data and resources inside Nexus Delta projects.

## Extensibility

Nexus Fusion aims to be an extensible web application that can serve generic needs of data visualization, governance 
and administration, while simultaneously serving domain specific needs of users. In order to facilitate this, we are 
adapting a plugin model where developers can adapt Nexus Fusion for their user's situation. This began in previous 
releases by introducing Plugins, and we will continue developing this direction with SubApps.

Nexus Fusion aims to be a frame, upon which many extension are hung.

## Notes

Nexus Fusion was previously named Nexus Web before version 1.4. We hope this new name will help reflect the mission 
of the application: combining features for users across the data-driven science stack into one tool.
