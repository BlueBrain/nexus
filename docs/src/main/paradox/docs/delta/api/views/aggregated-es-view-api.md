# AggregateElasticSearchView

This view is an aggregate of ElasticSearchViews. The view itself does not create any index, but it references the 
already existing indices of the linked ElasticSearchViews.

@@@ note

From Delta version 1.5.0,  `AggregateElasticSearchView` can point to other `AggregateElasticSearchView`s. 

@@@

When performing queries on the `_search` endpoint, this view will make use of the 
@link:[multi-index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/multi-index.html){ open=new } query 
capabilities of ElasticSearch in order to select the indices of every view present on this aggregate view.

If the caller does not have the permission views/query (or from v1.5, the user-defined permission) on all the views defined on the aggregated view,
only a subset of indices (or none) will be selected, respecting the defined permissions.

## Payload

```json
{
  "@id": "{someid}",
  "@type": "AggregateElasticSearchView",
  "views": [ 
    {
        "project": "{project}",
        "viewId": "{viewId}"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

where...
 
- `{project}`: String - The project, defined as `{org_label}/{project_label}`, where the `{viewId}` is located.
- `{viewId}`: Iri - The view @id value to be aggregated.

## Create using POST

```
POST /v1/views/{org_label}/{project_label}
  {...}
```

The json payload:

- If the `@id` value is found on the payload, this `@id` will be used.
- If the `@id` value is not found on the payload, an `@id` will be generated as follows: `base:{UUID}`. The `base` is the
  `prefix` defined on the resource's project (`{project_label}`).

Response

## Create using PUT

This alternative endpoint to create a view is useful in case the json payload does not contain an `@id` but you want to
specify one. The `@id` will be specified in the last segment of the endpoint URI.

```
PUT /v1/views/{org_label}/{project_label}/{view_id}
  {...}
```

Note that if the payload contains an `@id` different from the `{view_id}`, the request will fail.

## Update

This operation overrides the payload.

In order to ensure a client does not perform any changes to a resource without having had seen the previous revision of
the view, the last revision needs to be passed as a query parameter.

```
PUT /v1/views/{org_label}/{project_label}/{view_id}?rev={previous_rev}
  {...}
```

... where `{previous_rev}` is the last known revision number for the view.

## Deprecate

Locks the view, so no further operations can be performed.

Deprecating a view is considered to be an update as well.

@@@ note { .warning }

Deprecating a view makes the view not searchable.

@@@

```
DELETE /v1/views/{org_label}/{project_label}/{view_id}?rev={previous_rev}
```

... where `{previous_rev}` is the last known revision number for the view.

## Fetch

```

```

where ...

- `{rev}`: Number - the targeted revision to be fetched. This field is optional and defaults to the latest revision.
- `{tag}`: String - the targeted tag to be fetched. This field is optional.
  `{rev}` and `{tag}` fields cannot be simultaneously present.

## Search Documents

Provides aggregated search functionality across all the `ElasticSearchView`s referenced from the target `view_id`.

```
POST /v1/views/{org_label}/{project_label}/{view_id}/_search
  {...}
```
The supported payload is defined on the 
@link:[ElasticSearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-search.html#search-search-api-request-body){ open=new }

The string `documents` is used as a prefix of the default ElasticSearch `view_id`
