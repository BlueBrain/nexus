# Resources

Generic resources are rooted in the `/v1/resources/{org_label}/{project_label}/{schema_id}` collection.

Each resource... 

- belongs to a `project` identifier by the label `{project_label}`
- inside an `organization` identifier by the label `{org_label}` 
- it is validated against a `schema` with id `{schema_id}`. In case of using `_` for this segment, the schema segment 
  reads as `irrelevant`.

@@@ note { .tip title="Authorization notes" }	

When  modifying resources, the caller must have `resources/write` permissions on the current path of the project or the 
ancestor paths.

When  reading resources, the caller must have `resources/read` permissions on the current path of the project or the 
ancestor paths.

Please visit @ref:[Authentication & authorization](authentication.md) section to learn more about it.

@@@

@@@ note { .warning title="Remote contexts" }

Remote contexts are only resolved during creates and updates.
That means that when those get updated, the resources importing them must be also updated to take them into account in a new version.

@@@

@@@ note { .warning title="JSON payloads" }

The json payload for create and update operations cannot contain keys beginning with underscore (_), as these fields are reserved for Nexus metadata

@@@

## Nexus metadata

When using the endpoints described on this page, the responses will contain global metadata described on the
@ref:[Nexus Metadata](../metadata.md) page. In addition, the following resource specific metadata can be present

- `_project`: address of the resource's project
- `_incoming`: address to query to obtain the @ref:[list of incoming links](#list-incoming-links)
- `_outgoing`: address to query to obtain the @ref:[list of outgoing links](#list-outgoing-links)
- `_constrainedBy`: `@id` of the schema used to validate the resource; the schema can only be identified uniquely
  together with `_schemaProject`. If no schema has been used to validate the resource, it will indicate the
  unconstrained identifier.
- `_schemaProject`: address of the project where the `_constrainedBy` schema is found

## Indexing

All the API calls modifying a resource (creation, update, tagging, deprecation) can specify whether the resource should be indexed 
synchronously or in the background. This behaviour is controlled using `indexing` query param, which can be one of two values:

  - `async` - (default value) the resource will be indexed asynchronously 
  - `sync` - the resource will be indexed synchronously and the API call won't return until the indexing is finished

## Create using POST

```
POST /v1/resources/{org_label}/{project_label}/{schema_id}?tag={tag}
  {...}
```

The json payload: 

- If the `@id` value is found on the payload, this @id will be used.
- If the `@id` value is not found on the payload, an @id will be generated as follows: `base:{UUID}`. The `base` is the 
  `prefix` defined on the resource's project (`{project_label}`).

The `{schema_id}` segment allows to define an existing SHACL schema to validate the resource with:

- If `_` is provided, no SHACL validation will be performed
- If another value is provided, Nexus will attempt to resolve the schema then validate the expanded JSON-LD value generated 
from the provided payload.

The `{tag}` param is an optional tag associated with the first revision of this resource

**Example**

Request
:   @@snip [create.sh](assets/resources/create.sh)

Payload
:   @@snip [payload.json](assets/resources/payload.json)

Response
:   @@snip [created.json](assets/resources/created.json)


## Create using PUT

This alternative endpoint to create a resource is useful in case the json payload does not contain an `@id` but you want 
to specify one. The @id will be specified in the last segment of the endpoint URI.
```
PUT /v1/resources/{org_label}/{project_label}/{schema_id}/{resource_id}?tag={tag}
  {...}
```

... where `{tag}` is an optional tag associated with the first revision of this resource. 

The `{schema_id}` has the same behaviour as @ref:[the creation using post operation](#create-using-post).

Note that if the payload contains an @id different from the `{resource_id}`, the request will fail.

## Update

This operation overrides the payload.

In order to ensure a client does not perform any changes to a resource without having had seen the previous revision of
the resource, the last revision needs to be passed as a query parameter.

```
PUT /v1/resources/{org_label}/{project_label}/{schema_id}/{resource_id}?rev={previous_rev}&tag={tag}
  {...}
```
... where 

- `{previous_rev}` is the last known revision number for the resource.
- `{tag}` is an optional tag associated with the same revision as the current update. For example, if `previous_rev` is 2, both the updated payload and `tag` will be associated with revision 3; the new latest revision. 

The `{schema_id}` segment allows to define an existing SHACL schema to validate the resource with:

- If `_` is provided, no SHACL validation will be performed with the latest version of its current schema
- If another value is provided, it has to match the identifier of the current schema as changing the schema of a
resource is not currently supported. A different revision or tag of this schema can be provided though.

## Refresh

This operation refreshes the compacted and expanded representations of the resource.

This is equivalent of doing an update with the same source as the last revision of the resource. It is useful when the 
schema or project contexts have changed, in order for the changes to be reflected in the resource.

```
PUT /v1/resources/{org_label}/{project_label}/{schema_id}/{resource_id}/refresh
```

## Tag

Links a resource revision to a specific name. 

Tagging a resource is considered to be an update as well.

```

  {
    "tag": "{name}",
    "rev": {rev}
  }
```
... where 

- `{previous_rev}`: is the last known revision number for the resource.
- `{name}`: String - label given to the resources at specific revision.
- `{rev}`: Number - the revision to link the provided `{name}`.

## Remove tag

Removes a given tag.

Removing a tag is considered to be an update as well.

```

```
... where

- `{previous_rev}`: is the last known revision number for the resource.

## Deprecate

Locks the resource, so no further operations can be performed. It also deletes the resource from listing/querying results.

Deprecating a resource is considered to be an update as well. 

```
DELETE /v1/resources/{org_label}/{project_label}/{schema_id}/{resource_id}?rev={previous_rev}
```

Undeprecating a resource is considered to be an update as well.

```

### Parameter description

@@@ note { .tip title="How to use time ranges" }

A time range parameter allows to filter resources by their creation date or their last update date.

The provided dates can be:

* A date following the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`
* A wild card `*` to express no restriction on a limit

Examples of ranges:

* `2023-06-08T14:00:00Z..*`: Matchers resources created *after* the June 8, 2023 at 14.00
* `*..2023-06-08T14:00:00Z`: Matchers resources created *before* the June 8, 2023 at 14.00
* `2023-04-01T00:00:00Z..2023-06-08T14:00:00Z`: Matchers resources created *between* the April 1st at 00.00 and June 8, 2023 at 14.00

- `{size}`: Number - is the parameter that limits the number of results; defaults to `20`
- `{locate}`: Iri - can be used to find a resource by its `@id` or its address (`_self`)

### Aggregations

@@@ warning
Aggregations are experimental and the API is subject to change.
@@@

Adding the `aggregations=true` query parameter to a list query allows to aggregate the underlying resources by predefined terms. Currently, the following aggregations will be
returned:

* `projects`: a bucket aggregation of the resources by the project they belong to
* `types`: a bucket aggregation of the `@types` featured in the resources

Aggregation works on the same scopes as listing (all projects, organization, and project), and only aggregates the resources for which the caller has `resource/read` permission.

## List filtering by schema

This operation is only available at the project scope.
