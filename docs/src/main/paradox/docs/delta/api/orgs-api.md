# Organizations 

Organizations are rooted in the `/v1/orgs` path and are used to group and categorize sub-resources.

@@@ note { .tip title="Authorization notes" }	

When  creating organizations, the caller must have `organizations/create` permissions on the current path of the organization or `/`.

When  updating organizations, the caller must have `organizations/write` permissions on the current path of the organization or `/`.

When  reading organizations, the caller must have `organizations/read` permissions on the current path of the organization or `/`.

Please visit @ref:[Authentication & authorization](authentication.md) section to learn more about it.

## Payload

```json
{
  "description": "{description}"
}
```
...where `{description}` as an optional `String` providing some descriptive information about the organization.

## Create

```
PUT /v1/orgs/{label}
  {...}
```

...where `{label}` is the user friendly name assigned to this organization. The semantics of the `label` should be
consistent with the type of data provided by its sub-resources, since it'll be a part of the sub-resources' URI.

**Example**

Request
:   @@snip [create.sh](assets/organizations/create.sh)

Response
:   @@snip [created.json](assets/organizations/created.json)


## Update

This operation overrides the organization payload (description field).

In order to ensure a client does not perform any changes to an organization without having had seen the previous
revision of the organization, the last revision needs to be passed as a query parameter.

```
PUT /v1/orgs/{label}?rev={previous_rev}
  {...}
```
... where 

- `{previous_rev}`: Number - is the last known revision for the organization.
- `{label}`: String - is the user friendly name that identifies this organization.

**Example**

Request
:   @@snip [update.sh](assets/organizations/update.sh)

Response
:   @@snip [updated.json](assets/organizations/updated.json)

## Deprecate

Locks the organization, so that no further operations can be performed on the organization or on the child resources.

Deprecating an organization is considered to be an update as well. 

```
DELETE /v1/orgs/{label}?rev={previous_rev}
```

... where 

- `{label}`: String - is the user friendly name that identifies this organization.
- `{previous_rev}`: Number - is the last known revision for the organization.

**Example**

Request
:   @@snip [deprecate.sh](assets/organizations/deprecate.sh)

Response
:   @@snip [deprecated.json](assets/organizations/deprecated.json)

## Delete

Permanently delete an organization containing no projects. If there is a project, returns 409 Conflict.

The caller must have `organizations/delete` permissions.

```
DELETE /v1/orgs/{label}?prune=true
```

... where

- `{label}`: String - is the user friendly name that identifies this organization.
- `prune`: a flag to make permanent deletion explicit. To avoid mistakes, if `prune=true` then `rev` cannot be present and a 400 Bad Request will be returned.

**Example**

Request
:   @@snip [delete.sh](assets/organizations/delete.sh)

## Fetch (current version)

```
GET /v1/orgs/{label}
```

...where `{label}` is the user friendly `String` name that identifies this organization.

**Example**

Request

Response
:   @@snip [fetched.json](assets/organizations/fetched.json)

## Fetch (specific version)

```
GET /v1/orgs/{label}?rev={rev}
```
... where 

- `{rev}`: Number - is the revision of the organization to be retrieved.

## Server Sent Events

This endpoint allows clients to receive automatic updates from the organizations in a streaming fashion.

```
GET /v1/orgs/events
```

where `Last-Event-Id` is an optional HTTP Header that identifies the last consumed organization event. It can be used 
for cases when a client does not want to retrieve the whole event stream, but to start after a specific event.

The response contains a series of organization events, represented in the following way

```
data:{payload}
event:{type}
id:{id}
```

where...

- `{payload}`: Json - is the actual payload of the current organization event
- `{type}`: String - is a type identifier for the current organization. Possible types are: OrganizationCreated, 
  OrganizationUpdated and OrganizationDeprecated
- `{id}`: String - is the identifier of the organization event. It can be used in the `Last-Event-Id` HTTP Header
