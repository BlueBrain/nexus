# Nexus Forge

Blue Brain Nexus Forge is a domain-agnostic, generic and extensible Python framework enabling non-expert users to create and manage knowledge graphs by making it easy to:

* Discover and reuse available knowledge resources such as ontologies and schemas to shape, constraint, link and add semantics to datasets.
* Build knowledge graphs from datasets generated from heterogenous sources and formats. Defining, executing and sharing data mappers to transform data from a source format to a target one conformant to schemas and ontologies.
* Interface with various stores offering knowledge graph storage, management and scaling capabilities, for example Nexus Core store or in-memory store.
* Validate and register data and metadata.
* Search and download data and metadata from a knowledge graph.
