# v1.6 To v1.7 Migration

The v1.7 release of Delta includes changes on how Elasticsearch views and graph-analytics data are persisted.

Please note that you only need to do the graph-analytics part is you enabled the plugin in v.1.6.x.

When starting 1.7 for the first time, you need to run it with this environment variable set to `true`:

* MIGRATION_1_7

And if you enabled graph-analytics in v1.6, you also need to set this other environment variable to `true`:

* GRAPH_ANALYTICS_CLEANUP

Check the logs to make sure the migration is doing ok and restart Delta after the migration and the tag repair 
operation are completed without forgetting to remove the environment variables.
