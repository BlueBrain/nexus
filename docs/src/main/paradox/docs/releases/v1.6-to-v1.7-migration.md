# v1.5 To v1.6 Migration

The v1.6 release of Delta includes a change on how project statistics are computed which requires to run a query against the Cassandra primary store.

## Delete the project statistics row in the projections_progress table

This command has to be run after stopping Delta 1.5 and before starting Delta 1.6

        DELETE FROM {delta_1_5}.projections_progress where projection_id = 'ProjectsCounts';

Note that as project statistics will be recomputed according to all events in the system, it may take some time for the statistics computation to reach back to the most recent events.
