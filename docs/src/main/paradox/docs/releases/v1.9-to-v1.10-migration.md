# v1.9 To v1.10 Migration

## Default Elasticsearch views

As the mapping and setting of default Elasticsearch views have changed, it is necessary to update the views. For this
purpose, set the following environment variable when launching Nexus Delta 1.10.0 for the first time:

* `RESET_DEFAULT_ES_VIEWS`: true

The following logs should appear in Delta for each of your project:

```
2024-08-28 16:30:14 INFO  c.e.b.n.d.p.e.i.ElasticSearchDefaultViewsResetter - Created a new defaultElasticSearchView in project 'myorg/myproject'.
```

## Project event metrics

As the mapping and the structure of project event metrics has changed, it is necessary to reindex them. For this
purpose, set the following environment variable when launching Nexus Delta 1.10.0 for the first time: 

* `RESET_EVENT_METRICS`: true

The following logs should appear in Delta for each of your project:

```
2024-08-30 14:44:03 WARN  c.e.b.n.d.p.e.m.EventMetricsProjection - Resetting event metrics as the env RESET_EVENT_METRICS is set...
```
