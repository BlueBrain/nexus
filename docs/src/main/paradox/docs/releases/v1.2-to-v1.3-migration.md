# v1.2 To v1.3 Migration

As part of the v1.3 release @ref:[CompositeViews](../delta/api/current/views/composite-view-api.md) were introduced
requiring a change in the data model used to record the indexing progress of a View. The change is not backwards
compatible, it requires dropping two Cassandra tables and a rebuilding all indices. Additionally, in order to
benefit from the new ElasticSearch index configuration, a migration of the default ElasticSearchView of each
project is required.

The migration steps are as follows:

1. Stop the 3 services: iam, admin and kg.
2. @link:[Backup](https://docs.datastax.com/en/archived/cassandra/3.0/cassandra/operations/opsBackupRestore.html){ open=new } the
   cassandra store.
3. Delete all ElasticSearch indices:

        curl -XDELETE 'http://{elasticsearch_host}/kg_*'

4. Delete all BlazeGraph namespaces:

        for i in `curl -s 'http://{blazegraph_host}/blazegraph/namespace?describe-each-named-graph=false' | grep sparqlEndpoint | grep -o --color "rdf:resource=\"[^\"]*" | sed 's/rdf:resource="//' | sed 's#/sparql$##' | grep -v kb | grep -v LBS`
           do curl -X DELETE "$i"
        done

5. Drop the `kg.projections_progress` and the `kg.projections_failures` tables:

        drop table kg.projections_progress;
        drop table kg.projections_failures;

6. Deploy the new service images (tag `1.3`) for @link:[iam](https://hub.docker.com/r/bluebrain/nexus-iam){ open=new } and
   @link:[admin](https://hub.docker.com/r/bluebrain/nexus-admin){ open=new }.

7. Deploy the new @link:[kg](https://hub.docker.com/r/bluebrain/nexus-kg){ open=new } (tag `1.3`) image with the 
   `MIGRATE_V12_TO_V13=true` environment variable. This will instruct the service to automatically migrate the default 
   views. The service can be restarted without the migration environment variable after the following message is 
   presented in the log:

        Finished migrating views mappings. 

Once the services are restarted with the new images all ElasticSearch and BlazeGraph indices will be rebuilt
automatically. The progress for each view can be tracked either in Nexus Web or using the
@ref:[statistics endpoint](../delta/api/current/views/elasticsearch-view-api.md#fetch-statistics) for each view:

        GET /v1/views/{org_label}/{project_label}/{view_id}/statistics
