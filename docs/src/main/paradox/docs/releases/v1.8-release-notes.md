# v1.8 Release Notes

> This release marks a turn in the Nexus Ecosystem with different important changes:
> 
> The support for Cassandra as a primary store is removed and PostgreSQL 15+ is now the only supported primary store.
>
> The sourcing and indexing engine have been completely reworked to improve flexibility, scalability and performance.

since v1.7. //TODO update date of issues

## Nexus Delta

The goal of this release is to improve performance, flexibility, observability and developer productivity.
This is an incremental software release that also brings several improvements.

The API is mostly backwards compatible to v1.7 with two breaking changes due to changes in the sourcing and indexing engine:

* The offset is not a time-based uuid anymore but a sequence which consists of a bigint,
* As the indexing engine do not rely on events on anymore, the statistics for the different views returns the number of records that have been processed/remains to be processed.

### New primary store

Until Nexus 1.7, Nexus Delta was relying on @link:[Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html){ open=new } 
as a primary store that is to say the source of truth on which the Nexus ecosystem depends.

However, Cassandra became a growing problem for Nexus both in development and production contexts:

* The learning curve is steep both for using it in a developer context and running it in production,
* The tooling that allow to run it in a daily basis can be insufficient, time-consuming to properly set it up,
* The data modeling it imposes did not allow to accommodate the growing variety of present and future usages of Nexus,
* The eventual consistency was another hurdle for the Nexus usages
* The @link:[akka-persistence](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/index-persistence.html) library we relied on 
which is part of the akka stack changed @link:[its license a few months ago](https://www.lightbend.com/blog/why-we-are-changing-the-license-for-akka), 
so we could not get new updates from it,
* This library also did not fit anymore our needs in terms of indexing to external systems as performance is degrading over time
but also for data deletion.

So this pushed us to look for alternatives that would better address our needs.

@link:[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/){ open=new } is a database system with a strong reputation for performance, reliability and flexibility.
It allows to solve the pain points we were facing with Cassandra:

* Easier to learn, to operate in a daily basis,
* Can be run in different contexts from integration to large-scale production deployments,
* Widely used, a lot of resources and tools to use/deploy/monitor it,
* Flexible about data modeling,
* Transaction support, data integrity,
* Json support.

These reasons make PostgreSQL a better solution to be the primary store from Nexus 1.8 and to create a new sourcing
and indexing library on top of it.

### New sourcing and streaming library

This change of primary store in Nexus also comes with a new sourcing and streaming library.
It relies on a custom schema and is designed to:

* Embed directly the key concepts of project and entity type in the data model
* Be extensible by allowing to introduce new entities both global and related to a project
* Keep the history of changes by storing the log of events of the different entities
* Keep snapshots of entity states to allow:
  * Faster responses from the API as latest and tagged states don't need to be recomputed read and write actions
  * Faster indexing by allowing to fetch directly states before processing them
* Allow to delete undesirable projects in an efficient way

### New clustering deployment

If you were running Nexus in a cluster configuration, Nexus 1.8 doesn't rely anymore on Akka Cluster and moved to a new model
described in the @ref:[Architecture page](../delta/architecture.md#clustering).

### Name and description for resolvers, storages and views
It could be difficult for users to identify these different entities (for example in Fusion).
These two additional fields fills this gap by allowing users to add extra information.

### Views

#### Better reporting of indexing errors
Indexing errors for the different views are now available as Server Sent Events via the API making it easier to 
identify and fix them by either updating the resource or updating the view.

@ref:[More information](../delta/api/views/index.md#fetch-indexing-failures)

Errors related to indexing into Elasticsearch have also been improved to give more precise and relevant feedback. 

#### Only trigger reindexing when indexing is impacted

Indexing views will now only restart if its new configuration changes the way, data is impacted.
For example, updating the name, the description or the permission of the view won't trigger reindexing anymore.

#### Indexing @id for custom Elasticsearch views

When a resource does not include an id in its original payload, the id of the resource (for example in the case,
the `@id` is generated) will be injected in the Elasticsearch payload.

### Resources and schemas

#### Search by @id and _self

A new parameter `locate` has been introduced in the listing API that enables searching a resource within a project, an org
or within all projects by providing its `@id` or its `_self`

@ref:[More information](../delta/api/schemas-api.md#list)

#### Refresh resources and schemas
A new `refresh` operation is available for resources and schemas. It allows to update a resource/schema when one of its
upstream dependencies has changed without having to provide again its original payload.
@ref:[More information for resources](../delta/api/resources-api.md#refresh)
@ref:[More information for schemas](../delta/api/schemas-api.md#refresh)

#### Validate
This new validate operation allows to check a resource against a provided schema.
This operation is read-only and allows to test a schema against different resources

@ref:[More information](../delta/api/resources-api.md#validate)

#### Annotated original payload

It is now possible to fetch in a single the original payload of a resource alongside its metadata:

### Supervision API

A supervision API has been added to get information about the running projections on the current node:
