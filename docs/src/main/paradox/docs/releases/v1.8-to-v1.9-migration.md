# v1.8 To v1.9 Migration

## self, incoming and outgoing links

@@@ note { .warning title="Reindexing" }

Reindexing can consume a lot of CPU/memory if many views are indexing in parallel, please proceed by restarting only a subset of them at a time so as to not
overload the system.

@@@

As those links are not shortened anymore (@ref:[see here](./v1.9-release-notes.md#self-incoming-and-outgoing-links)),
we encourage Nexus deployments moving to 1.9 to reindex your different views containing metadata.

This operation can be performing by deleting the offset for the different views by using the different endpoints:

* @ref:[Elasticsearch views](../delta/api/views/elasticsearch-view-api.md#restart-indexing)
* @ref:[Blazegraph views](../delta/api/views/sparql-view-api.md#restart-indexing)
* @ref:[Composite views](../delta/api/views/composite-view-api.md#restart-indexing)

Nexus Fusion also allows to restart the indexing for the different views.
