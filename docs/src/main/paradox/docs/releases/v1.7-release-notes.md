//TODO Update end date 
@link:[list of addressed issues](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+closed%3A2021-10-14..2022-02-01+){ open=new }
since v1.6.

If you are currently using Nexus Delta from 1.6.x, please
visit the @ref:[migration instructions](v1.6-to-v1.7-migration.md) for the necessary steps to successfully upgrade.

## Nexus Delta

The main goal of this release is to provide support for an enhanced search experience in Fusion as well as to introduce
a new extensible model to define Elasticsearch views based on pipes.

Secondary goals include:

//TODO update the links to 1.6.x

- @link:[Removal of the Nexus cli](https://bluebrainnexus.io/v1.5.x/docs/utilities/index.html#nexus-cli)
- @link:[Removal of the docker based client](https://bluebrainnexus.io/v1.5.x/docs/utilities/projections.html)
- Allow the use of an external configuration file for Delta
- Allow deleting tags on resources
- Allow tagging deprecated storages and views
- Refactor `graph-analytics` plugin to make indexing faster

A series of bugs have also been fixed with this new release.

### Deprecations

In the upcoming version, the support of Cassandra as a primary store for Nexus Delta will be removed in favour of PostgreSQL to focus development efforts on features rather than supporting multiple databases. 
For very large deployments there are commercial options that are wire compatible to PostgreSQL.

Tools will be provided to enable migration from Cassandra to PostgreSQL for existing Delta deployments.

### Elasticsearch pipes

With 1.7, Elasticsearch views now rely on pipes to filter and transform data before indexing.

More details @ref:[here](../delta/api/views/elasticsearch-view-api.md)

This change implies a @ref:[migration when updating Nexus Delta to 1.7](v1.6-to-v1.7-migration.md).

### Allow the use of an external configuration file for Delta

Besides JVM properties and environment variables, Delta configuration can now be defined via a external file.

More details @ref:[here](../getting-started/running-nexus/configuration/index.md)

### Deleting tags on resources

From 1.7, it is now possible to delete tags on resources, files and schemas.

### Tagging deprecated storages and views

Storages and views can now be tagged even after they have been deprecated.

### Graph analytics

Graph analytics indexing is now faster.

If you enabled this plugin in your 1.6 deployment, @ref:[there are migration steps to follow](v1.6-to-v1.7-migration.md).

## Nexus Fusion

- Graph analytics UI (introduced in Nexus Delta v1.6) enabling users to inspect properties and relationships of resources in a given project
- Studio support for Elasticsearch and Composite views with an updated UI. Elasticsearch studios provide the option for more performant Studios compared to studios targetting a Sparql view. The Studio data model has changed to support this, see migration notes for migrating existing Studios
- Search has been further enhanced
  - Default configurations support convenient access to apply common search criteria
  - Numeric and date type column support
- Jump to Studio directly from the Search bar
- Several enhancements to the UI
  - Redesigned Resources panel with quick access to high-level details of resource. Plugin open/closed status is also persisted improving the UX when wanting to view the same plugin(s) for several resources
  - Colour scheme has been updated to better align with our style guide
 - Navigation has moved from the sidebar to the header giving more screen real-estate
- Zoom/pan support for PDFs in Preview plugin making it easier to preview large PDFs
- Navigation of linked resources by versioned identifiers
- Support deleting a tag on a given resource

A series of bugs have also been fixed.
