@link:[list of addressed issues](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+closed%3A2021-10-14..2022-02-01+){ open=new }

## Nexus Delta

The main goal of this release is to provide support for an enhanced search experience in Fusion as well as to introduce
a new extensible model to define Elasticsearch views based on pipes.

Secondary goals include:

//TODO update the links to 1.6.x

- @link:[Deletion of the Nexus cli](https://bluebrainnexus.io/docs/v1.5.x/utilities/index.html#nexus-cli)
- @link:[Deletion of the docker based client](https://bluebrainnexus.io/v1.5.x/docs/utilities/projections.html)
- Allow to define an external file for Delta configuration
- Allow deleting tags on resources
- Allow tagging deprecated storages and views
- Refactor `graph-analytics` plugin to make indexing faster

A series of bugs have also been fixed with this new release.

### Deprecations

In an upcoming version, the support of Cassandra as a primary store for Nexus Delta will be removed.

Nexus Delta will only focus on PostgreSQL to achieve this role as it better fits its needs.

Tools will be provided to enable migration from Cassandra to PostgreSQL for existing Delta deployments.

### Elasticsearch pipes

With 1.7, Elasticsearch views now rely on pipes to filter and transform data before indexing.

More details @ref:[here](../delta/api/views/elasticsearch-view-api.md)

This change implies a @ref:[migration when updating Nexus Delta to 1.7](v1.6-to-v1.7-migration.md).

### Allow to define an external file for Delta configuration

Besides JVM properties and environment variables, Delta configuration can now be defined via a external file.

More details @ref:[here](../getting-started/running-nexus/configuration/index.md)

### Deleting tags on resources

From 1.7, it is now possible to delete tags on resources, files and schemas.

### Tagging deprecated storages and views

Storages and views can now be tagged even after they have been deprecated.

### Graph analytics

Graph analytics indexing is now faster.

If you enabled this plugin in your 1.6 deployment, @ref:[there are migration steps to follow](v1.6-to-v1.7-migration.md).
