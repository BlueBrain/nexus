# v1.4 Release Notes

> This release marks an expansion to the Nexus Ecosystem which now comprises 3 key products:

- Nexus Fusion (v1.4) to enable collaborative data and knowledge discovery,
- Nexus Forge (v0.3.3) to ease building and using Knowledge Graphs,
- Nexus Delta (v1.4) to manage the data and Knowledge Graph lifecycle.

For the detailed list of updates in this release, see the 
@link:[list of pull requests](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+created%3A2020-02-25..2020-08-14){ open=new } 
since 1.3.0.

## Nexus Forge

The latest release of Nexus Forge (v0.3.3), the python framework to make building and using knowledge graphs easier, 
adds incremental features across its core and specializations modules.

The detailed release note of Nexus Forge 0.3.3 is available 
@link:[here](https://nexus-forge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/v0.3.3-release-notes.html){ open=new }.

## Nexus Delta

The goal of this release is to improve performance and shrink the service footprint when deploying the Nexus ecosystem.
This is an incremental software release that adds several improvements across the board. The API is backwards
compatible to v1.3 (and the rest of the v1.x releases, i.e. v1.2, v1.1 and v1.0) but requires rebuilding all indices 
and performing schema migrations. Please visit the @ref:[migration instructions](v1.3-to-v1.4-migration.md) for the 
exact steps necessary to upgrade from the previous release.

### Services merge

Up until 1.3, Nexus backend  was splitted into 3 services:

- iam: dealing with identity and access management.
- admin: dealing with organizations and project management.
- kg: dealing with resources and their lifecycle.

In 1.4 we have merged the 3 services together. Combining the 3 services into one has the following benefits:

- Easier to deploy, test and monitor.
- Decrease latency since the services do not have to interact with each other. The degree to which this aspect improves 
  depends on the quality of the network where the service are running.

#### Listing results

Listing API responses return, along with the resource metadata, the following predicates: `sko:prefLabel`, `schema:name` 
and `rdfs:label` when they are present in the resource payload.

```
GET /v1/resources/{org_label}/{project_label}
```

An example response:

```json

## Nexus Fusion

With the addition of new features in our Nexus Web application, and in anticipation of some exciting future developments, 
we evolved Nexus Web into Nexus Fusion.

Nexus Fusion now supports multiple subapps and clearly defined spaces for different uses:

- @ref:[Admin](../fusion/admin.md): the place where you can manage organizations, projects, and resources, visualize 
  permissions, and access the different query editor. You can also manage create new studios in your project.
- @ref:[Studios](../fusion/studio.md): access studios available to you and create new and configure existing studios. 
  Studios let you organize resources present in your knowledges graphs (or projects) into tables, and navigate 
  individual resources.

We've made big improvements to the way @ref:[Plugins](../fusion/plugins.md) work accross all resources:

- Configure your resource-plugin mappings for your instance, so that users get a consistent experience visualizing resources;
- Some default plugins are available out-of-the-box, such as the Admin plugin.
