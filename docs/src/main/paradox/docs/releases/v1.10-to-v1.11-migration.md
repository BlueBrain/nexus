# v1.10 To v1.11 Migration

## Passivation

Passivation relies on a process which computes incrementally the last offset and updates for every project.
It is recommended to let it catch up and computes those values from the state log before enabling passivation for views.

The time to catch up depends on the number of entries in the state log.

To check that passivation is ready to be enabled, those to queries can be run:

```sql
SELECT org, project,ordering, instant 
FROM scoped_states 
ORDER BY ordering DESC LIMIT 100
```

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM public.project_last_updates 
ORDER BY last_ordering DESC
```

When the ordering and instant values are consistent, @ref:[then passivation can be enabled](../delta/api/views/index.md#passivation).
