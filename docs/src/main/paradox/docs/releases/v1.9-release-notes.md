### Resources

#### Resources

It is now forbidden for JSON payloads to contain fields beginning with underscore (_). This can be disabled be setting `app.resources.decoding-option` to `lenient`, however it is not recommended as specification of this data in payloads can have unexpected consequences in both data and the user-interface

Listings by types can now be controlled with the `typeOperator` query parameter. Possible values are `or` and `and`, which will match any and all types, respectively.

#### Aggregations

It is now possible to aggregate resources by `@type` or `project`.

### Archives

Resources can be added to an archive using a `_self`.
