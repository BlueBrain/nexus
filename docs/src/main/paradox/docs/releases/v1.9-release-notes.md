# v1.9 Release Notes

TODO add link to full changes on github

TODO add potential migration page

## Nexus Delta

### Resources

#### Payload validation

It is now forbidden for JSON payloads to contain fields beginning with underscore (_). This can be disabled be setting `app.resources.decoding-option` to `lenient`, however it is not recommended as specification of this data in payloads can have unexpected consequences in both data and the user-interface

Listings by types can now be controlled with the `typeOperator` query parameter. Possible values are `or` and `and`, which will match any and all types, respectively.

#### Aggregations

It is now possible to aggregate resources by `@type` or `project`.

### Views

Indexing errors can now be listed and filtered for a given view.

@ref:[More information](../delta/api/views/index.md#listing-indexing-failures)

### Archives

Resources can be added to an archive using a `_self`.

@ref:[More information](../delta/api/archives-api.md#payload)

### Storages

Storages can no longer be created with credentials that would get stored:

* For S3 storages, this would be `accessKey`/`secretKey`. 
* For remote storages, this means `credentials`. 

These should instead be defined in the Delta configuration.
