# Nexus Components

The Nexus platform is made up of a collection of services and web applications that work together to manage data stored
within the system.  The services and web applications are powered by a collection of libraries and tools built
specifically to address the needs of the platform.  Underneath it all there are popular open source technologies that
we all know and love.

Please take a look at [these slides](https://www.slideshare.net/BogdanRoman1/bluebrain-nexus-technical-introduction-91266871)
