# Nexus Components

The Nexus platform is made up of a collection of services and web applications that work together to manage data stored
within the system.  The services and web applications are powered by a collection of libraries and tools built
specifically to address the needs of the platform.  Underneath it all there are popular open source technologies that
we all know and love.
