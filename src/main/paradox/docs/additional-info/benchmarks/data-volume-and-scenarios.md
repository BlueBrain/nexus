# Data volume and scenarios

Prior to the test execution a reasonable amount of data was injected into the system to ensure the system behaves well
under a typical volume. Specifically:

*   Total number of resources: 115,690,687
*   Total number of triples (edges): 2,493,134,304
*   Total number of entities (nodes): 352,856,595
*   Total number of property types: 74
*   Total number of classes (distinct values of `@type`): 24

The data was generated by replicating a collection of _provenance patterns_, each spanning several resources:

*   resource [examples](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus-tests/tree/master/src/main/resources/bbp)
*   corresponding SHACL [schemas](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus-tests/tree/master/scripts/schemas)

The full collection of scenarios can be found [here](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus-tests/tree/master/src/it/scala/ch/epfl/bluebrain/nexus/perf)
each within its own file.

Several scenarios were executed to verify the behaviour of the system, most notably:

*   create resource (with validation)
*   create resource (without validation)
*   get resource by id
*   tag resource
*   get resource by revision, get resource by tag
*   mixed operations: list resources, get resource by id, ElasticSearch query, BlazeGraph query, update resource
