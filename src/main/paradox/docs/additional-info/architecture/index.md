# System Architecture

The architecture section is to provide a comprehensive architectural overview of the Nexus platform. It presents a
number of architectural views to depict various aspects of the system. It is intended to convey the significant
architectural decisions which have been made on the system.

## Presentation

A one hour talk was given at the Scala Romandie meetup
[Building a knowledge graph for data driven science](https://www.meetup.com/Scala-Romandie/events/258897390/).

It goes through key design decisions behind building Nexus and highlights from the concrete implementation in our Scala
codebase.
