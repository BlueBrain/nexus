# Components

![Component View](components.png)

The Nexus platform is made up of a collection of services and web applications that work together to manage data stored
within the system. The services and web applications are powered by a collection of libraries and tools built
specifically to address the needs of the platform. Underneath it all there are popular open source technologies that
we all know and love.

## Nexus Services

### Nexus KnowledgeGraph

This service is the heart of the BlueBrain Nexus platform. It allows users to define their domain, populate the
knowledge graph with data, attach files to data. It also provides semantic search facilities to discover similar and
relevant data in the platform.

### Nexus Admin

This service manages the platform wide scopes for data and their configuration (i.e.: the API mapping).

### Nexus IAM

This service manages the access to data within the platform. It makes use of configurable downstream OpenID Connect
compliant identity providers to authenticate clients and manages the access controls for the entire platform.

## Nexus Web Applications

### Nexus Web

This is the web interface to the platform. It allows users to browse the data within the system and perform administration tasks.
