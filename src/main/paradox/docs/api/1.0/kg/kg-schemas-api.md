# Schemas

Schemas are rooted in the `/v1/schemas/{org_label}/{project_label}` collection. They define a set of rules and constraints using [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/). Once those schemas are present, other resources can be created against them. Those resources won't be successfully created unless they match the required constraints defined on the schema.

Each schema... 

- belongs to a `project` identifier by the label `{project_label}` 
- inside an `organization` identifier by the label `{org_label}` 
- it is validated against the [shacl schema](https://bluebrainnexus.io/schemas/shacl-20170720.ttl) (version 20170720).

Access to resources in the system depends on the access control list set for them. Depending on the access control list, a caller may need to prove its identity by means of an **access token** passed to the `Authorization` header (`Authorization: Bearer {token}`). Please visit @ref:[Authentication](../iam/authentication.md) to learn more about how to retrieve an access token.

When  modifying schemas, the caller must have `schemas/write` permissions on the current path of the project or the ancestor paths.

When  reading schemas, the caller must have `resources/read` permissions on the current path of the project or the ancestor paths.

## Create a schema using POST

```
POST /v1/schemas/{org_label}/{project_label}
  {...}
```

The json payload: 

- If the `@id` value is found on the payload, this @id will be used.
- If the `@id` value is not found on the payload, an @id will be generated as follows: `base:{UUID}`. The `base` is the `prefix` defined on the resource's project (`{project_label}`).

Request
:   @@snip [schema.sh](../assets/schemas/schema.sh)

Payload
:   @@snip [schema.json](../assets/schemas/schema.json)

Response
:   @@snip [schema-ref-new.json](../assets/schemas/schema-ref-new.json)


## Create a schema using PUT
This alternative endpoint to create a schema is useful in case the json payload does not contain an `@id` but you want to specify one. The @id will be specified in the last segment of the endpoint URI.
```
PUT /v1/schemas/{org_label}/{project_label}/{schema_id}
  {...}
```
 
Note that if the payload contains an @id different from the `{schema_id}`, the request will fail.

## Update a schema

This operation overrides the payload.

In order to ensure a client does not perform any changes to a resource without having had seen the previous revision of
the resource, the last revision needs to be passed as a query parameter.

```
PUT /v1/schemas/{org_label}/{project_label}/{schema_id}?rev={previous_rev}
  {...}
```
... where `{previous_rev}` is the last known revision number for the schema.

:   @@snip [schema.json](../assets/schemas/schema.json)

Response
:   @@snip [schema-ref-new-updated.json](../assets/schemas/schema-ref-new-updated.json)


## Tag a schema

Links a schema revision to a specific name. 

Tagging a schema is considered to be an update as well.

```
PUT /v1/schemas/{org_label}/{project_label}/{schema_id}/tags?rev={previous_rev}
  {
    "tag": "{name}",
    "rev": {rev}
  }
```
... where 

- `{previous_rev}`: Number - is the last known revision for the resolver.
- `{name}`: String - label given to the schemas at specific revision.
- `{rev}`: Number - the revision to link the provided `{name}`.

## Deprecate a schema

Locks the schema, so no further operations can be performed. It also deletes the schema from listing/querying results.

Deprecating a schema is considered to be an update as well. 

```
DELETE /v1/schemas/{org_label}/{project_label}/{schema_id}?rev={previous_rev}
```

... where `{previous_rev}` is the last known revision number for the schema.

where...

- `{full_text_search_query}`: String - can be provided to select only the schemas in the collection that have attribute values matching (containing) the provided token; when this field is provided the results will also include score values for each result
- `{from}`: Number - is the parameter that describes the offset for the current query; defaults to `0`
- `{size}`: Number - is the parameter that limits the number of results; defaults to `20`
- `{deprecated}`: Boolean - can be used to filter the resulting schemas based on their deprecation status
- `{rev}`: Number - can be used to filter the resulting schemas based on their revision value
- `{type}`: Iri - can be used to filter the resulting schemas based on their `@type` value. This parameter can appear multiple times, filtering further the `@type` value.
- `{createdBy}`: Iri - can be used to filter the resulting schemas based on their creator
- `{updatedBy}`: Iri - can be used to filter the resulting schemas based on the person which performed the last update
