# Views

Views are rooted in the `/v1/views/{org_label}/{project_label}` collection and are used to index the selected resources into a bucket. 


Each view... 

- belongs to a `project` identifier by the label `{project_label}` 
- inside an `organization` identifier by the label `{org_label}` 
- it is validated against the [view schema](https://bluebrainnexus.io/schemas/view.json).

Access to resources in the system depends on the access control list set for them. Depending on the access control list, a caller may need to prove its identity by means of an **access token** passed to the `Authorization` header (`Authorization: Bearer {token}`). Please visit @ref:[Authentication](../iam/authentication.md) to learn more about how to retrieve an access token.

@@@ note { .tip title="Authorization notes" }	

When  modifying views, the caller must have `views/write` permissions on the current path of the project or the ancestor paths.

When  querying views, the caller must have `views/query` permissions on the current path of the project or the ancestor paths.

When  reading views, the caller must have `resources/read` permissions on the current path of the project or the ancestor paths.

## View types

![view defaults](../assets/views/view-defaults.png "View defaults")


There are several types of views, which relies on different technology to perform the indexing

### SparqlView

This view creates a SPARQL `namespace` where it stores all the resource's graph inside the view `project`.

This view gets automatically created when the project is created and it cannot be modified.


**SparqlView payload**
```
{
  "@id": "nxv:defaultSparqlIndex",
  "@type": [ "View", "SparqlView" ]
}
```

### ElasticSearchView

@@@ note

The described features are in `@Alpha` phase of development. The operations might change in the future.

@@@

This view creates an ElasticSearch `index` where it stores the selected resources inside the view `project`.

A default view gets automatically created when the project is created but other views can be created.

**ElasticSearchView payload**
```
{
  "@id": "{someid}",
  "@type": [ "View", "ElasticSearchView", "Alpha" ],
  "resourceSchemas": [ "{resourceSchema}", ...],
  "resourceTag": "{tag}",
  "sourceAsText": {sourceAsText},
  "includeMetadata": {includeMetadata},
  "mapping": _elasticsearch mapping_
}
```

where...
 
- `{resourceSchema}`: Iri - It selects the resources that are validated against the provided schema Iri. This field is optional.
- `{tag}`: String - It selects the resources with the provided tag. This field is optional.
- `_elasticsearch mapping_`: Json object - It defines the value types for the Json keys, as stated at the [ElasticSearch mapping documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-put-mapping.html#indices-put-mapping).
- `{sourceAsText}`: Boolean - If true, the resource's payload will be stored in the ElasticSearch document as a single escaped string value of the key `_original_source`. If false, the resource's payload will be stored normally in the ElasticSearch document. The default value is `false`.
- `{includeMetadata}`: Boolean - If true, the resource's nexus metadata (`_constrainedBy`, `_deprecated`, ...) will be stored in the ElasticSearch document. Otherwise it won't. The default value is `false`.
- `{someid}`: Iri - the @id value for this view.


### AggregateElasticSearchView

@@@ note

The described features are in `@Alpha` phase of development. The operations might change in the future.

@@@

This view is an aggregate of ElasticSearchViews. The view itself does not create any index, but it reference to the already existing indices of the linked ElasticSearchViews.

When performing queries on the `_search` endpoint, this view will make use of the [multi-index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/multi-index.html) query capabilities of ElasticSearch in order to select the indices of every view present on this aggregate view.

If the caller does not have the permission `views/query` on all the projects defined on the aggregated view, only a subset of indices (or none) will be selecting, respecting the defined permissions.

![Aggregate ElasticSearchView](../assets/views/aggregate-view.png "Aggregate ElasticSearchView")

**AggregateElasticSearchView payload**
```
{
  "@id": "{someid}",
  "@type": [ "View", "AggregateElasticSearchView", "Alpha" ],
  "views": [ 
    {
        "project": "{project}",
        "viewId": "{viewId}"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

where...
 
- `{project}`: String - the project, defined as `{org_label}/{project_label}`, where the `{viewId}` is located.
- `{viewId}`: Iri - The view @id value to be aggregated.


## Create an ElasticSearchView using POST

```
POST /v1/view/{org_label}/{project_label}
  {...}
```

The json payload: 

- If the `@id` value is found on the payload, this @id will be used.
- If the `@id` value is not found on the payload, an @id will be generated as follows: `base:{UUID}`. The `base` is the `prefix` defined on the view's project (`{project_label}`).

## Create an ElasticSearchView using PUT

This alternative endpoint to create a view is useful in case the json payload does not contain an `@id` but you want to specify one. The @id will be specified in the last segment of the endpoint URI.
```
PUT /v1/views/{org_label}/{project_label}/{view_id}
  {...}
```
 
Note that if the payload contains an @id different from the `{view_id}`, the request will fail.

## Update an ElasticSearchView

This operation overrides the payload.

In order to ensure a client does not perform any changes to a view without having had seen the previous revision of
the view, the last revision needs to be passed as a query parameter.

```
PUT /v1/views/{org_label}/{project_label}/{view_id}?rev={previous_rev}
  {...}
```
... where `{previous_rev}` is the last known revision number for the view.

## Tag a View

Links a view's revision to a specific name. 

Tagging a view is considered to be an update as well.

```

  {
    "tag": "{name}",
    "rev": {rev}
  }
```
... where 

- `{previous_rev}`: Number - the last known revision for the resolver.
- `{name}`: String - label given to the view at specific revision.
- `{rev}`: Number - the revision to link the provided `{name}`.

## Deprecate a view

Locks the view, so no further operations can be performed. It also stops indexing any more resources into it.

Deprecating a view is considered to be an update as well. 

```

```

... where `{previous_rev}` is the last known revision number for the view.

## Views internals

When an asynchronous process that reads the view events from the Primary Store gets triggered, a new index (SparQL or ElasticSearch) gets created. After that, an endpoint (`/sparql` for SparQL view or `/_search` for ElasticSearch view) becomes available. The client can then perform queries against those endpoints.

The view provides the configuration of the index and defines which Events are going to be indexed.
