# Permissions

Permissions are rooted in the `/v1/permissions` collection.

Each permission is the basic unit to provide a way to limit applications' access to sensitive information.  

Access to resources in the system depends on the access control list set for them. Depending on the access control list, a caller may need to prove its identity by means of an **access token** passed to the `Authorization` header (`Authorization: Bearer {token}`). Please visit @ref:[Authentication](./authentication.md) to learn more about how to retrieve an access token.

When  modifying permissions, the caller must have `permissions/write` permissions on the path `/`.

When  reading permissions, the caller must have `permissions/read` permissions on the path `/`.

## Minimum permissions

IAM is configured to include minimum permissions, i.e. permissions that cannot be removed, because they are necessary for correct functioning of Nexus.

Currently the following permissions are required:

-  default permissions for acls, with the exception that everyone should be able to see his own permissions
    - `acls/read`
    - `acls/write`

- default permissions for permissions
    - `permissions/read`
    - `permissions/write`

- default permissions for realms
    - `realms/read`
    - `realms/write`

 - generic permissions for full read access to the global event log
    - `events/read`

-  admin specific permissions
    - `projects/read`
    - `projects/write`
    - `projects/create`
    - `organizations/read`
    - `organizations/write`
    - `organizations/create`

- KG specific permissions
    - `resources/read`
    - `resources/write`
    - `resolvers/write`
    - `views/query`
    - `views/write`
    - `schemas/write`
    - `files/write`


## Replace permissions

This operation overrides the collection of permissions.
```
PUT /v1/permissions?rev={previous_rev}
  {...}
```

...where ``{previous_rev}`` is the last known revision number for the permissions.
If there are only minimum permissions present present, this query parameter can be omitted.

The json payload contains the set of permissions to be added.
