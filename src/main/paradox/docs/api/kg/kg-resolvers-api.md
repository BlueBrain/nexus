# Resolvers

Resolvers are rooted in the `/v1/resolvers/{org_label}/{project_label}` collection and are used in the following scenarios:

- Bring the content of the `owl:imports` predicate for schema resources. The value is the `@id` of the resource. E.g.: You can define owl imports on a schema, as follows `"owl:imports": "http://example.com/myid"`. The resolver will try to find a resource with `"@id": "http://example.com/myid"` and if found, will bring the payload into the original resource. 
- Bring the content of the `@context` links. The value is the `@id` of the resource. E.g.: A resource might define the context as follows: `"@context": "http://example.com/id"`. The resolver will try to find a resource with `"@id": "http://example.com/id"` and if found, will bring the payload into the original resource. 

Each resolver... 

- belongs to a `project` identifier by the label `{project_label}` 
- inside an `organization` identifier by the label `{org_label}` 
- it is validated against the [resolver schema](https://bluebrainnexus.io/schemas/resolver.json).

Access to resources in the system depends on the access control list set for them. Depending on the access control list, a caller may need to prove its identity by means of an **access token** passed to the `Authorization` header (`Authorization: Bearer {token}`). Please visit @ref:[Authentication](../iam/authentication.md) to learn more about how to retrieve an access token.

@@@ note { .tip title="Authorization notes" }	

When  modifying resolvers, the caller must have `resolvers/write` permissions on the current path of the project or the ancestor paths.

When  reading resolvers, the caller must have `resources/read` permissions on the current path of the project or the ancestor paths.

## Resolver types

There are several types of resolvers, which perform resolution in different scopes.

### InProject resolver

The scope of the resolution is the current project where the resource resides. In other words:

- Schema `A` can import schema `B` using the `owl:import` as long as schema `B` is located on the same project as schema `A`. 
- Resource `A` can reference resource's context `B` (inside `@context`) as long as resource `B` is located on the same project as resource `A`. 

This resolver gets automatically created when the project is created and it cannot be modified.

**InProject resolver payload**
```
{
    "@id": "nxv:InProject",
    "@type": [ "InProject", "Resolver" ],
    "priority": {priority},
}
```

where `{priority}` is a numeric value (from 1 - 100) which defines the resolution priority when attempting to find the resource with a particular @id.

### CrossProject resolver

The scope of the resolution is the collections of projects `P` defined on the resolver. CrossProject resolution also defines a collection of identities `I` to enforce ACLs. In other words:

- Schema `A` can import schema `B` using the `owl:import` as long as schema `B` is located on some of the projects from the collection `P` and as long `I` have `resources/read` permissions on the schema `B` project.
- Resource `A` can reference resource's context `B` (inside `@context`) as long as resource `B` is located on some of the projects from the collection `P` and as long as `I` have `resources/read` permissions on the schema `B` project.


**CrossProject resolver payload**
```
{
  "@id": "{someid}",
  "@type": ["Resolver", "CrossProject"],
  "resourceTypes": ["{resourceType}", ...],
  "projects": ["{project}", ... ],
  "identities": [ {_identity_}, {...} ],
  "priority": 50
}
```

where...

- `{resourceType}`: Iri - resolves only the resources with `@type` containing `{resourceType}`. This field is optional.
- `{priority}`: Number - value (from 1 - 100) which defines the resolution priority when attempting to find the resource with a particular @id.
- `{project}`: String - the user friendly reference to the project from where the resolution process will attempt to find the @id's. It follows the format `{organization}/{project}`.
- `_identity_`: Json object - the identity against which to enforce ACLs during resolution process.
- `{someid}`: Iri - the @id value for this resolver.

## Create a resolver using POST

```
POST /v1/resolvers/{org_label}/{project_label}
  {...}
```

The json payload: 

- If the `@id` value is found on the payload, this @id will be used.
- If the `@id` value is not found on the payload, an @id will be generated as follows: `base:{UUID}`. The `base` is the `prefix` defined on the resolver's project (`{project_label}`).

## Create a resolver using PUT
This alternative endpoint to create a resolver is useful in case the json payload does not contain an `@id` but you want to specify one. The @id will be specified in the last segment of the endpoint URI.
```
PUT /v1/resolvers/{org_label}/{project_label}/{resolver_id}
  {...}
```
 
Note that if the payload contains an @id different from the `{resolver_id}`, the request will fail.

## Update a resolver

This operation overrides the payload.

In order to ensure a client does not perform any changes to a resolver without having had seen the previous revision of
the resolver, the last revision needs to be passed as a query parameter.

```
PUT /v1/resolvers/{org_label}/{project_label}/{resolver_id}?rev={previous_rev}
  {...}
```
... where `{previous_rev}` is the last known revision number for the resolver.

## Tag a resolver

Links a resolver revision to a specific name. 

Tagging a resolver is considered to be an update as well.

```
PUT /v1/resolvers/{org_label}/{project_label}/{resolver_id}/tags?rev={previous_rev}
  {
    "tag": "{name}",
    "rev": {rev}
  }
```
... where 

- `{previous_rev}`: Number - the last known revision for the resolver.
- `{name}`: String - label given to the resolver at specific revision.
- `{rev}`: Number - the revision to link the provided `{name}`.

## Deprecate a resolver

Locks the resolver, so no further operations can be performed. It will also not be taken into account in the resolution process.

Deprecating a resolver is considered to be an update as well. 

```
DELETE /v1/resolvers/{org_label}/{project_label}/{resolver_id}?rev={previous_rev}
```

... where `{previous_rev}` is the last known revision number for the resolver.
