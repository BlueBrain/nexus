# v1.3 Release Notes

This is an incremental software release that adds several improvements across the board. The API is backwards
compatible to v1.2 but requires rebuilding all indices. Please visit the @ref:[migration instructions](v1.2-to-v1.3-migration.md)
for the exact steps necessary to upgrade.

## CompositeViews

CompositeViews are yet another type of view introduced (currently in Beta) to enable new indexing capabilities: 

* ability to collect data to be indexed from multiple sources (current project, other projects, remote Nexus
  deployments);
* ability to apply transformations to the indexed data by means of `SPARQL CONSTRUCT` queries that are executed on the
  entire RDF graph generated from all data sources;
* ability to project data to multiple indices;
* ability to query multiple projections of the same type;
* ability to query the entire RDF graph generated from all data sources.

The name stems from its unique characteristic of aggregating data from multiple sources and managing multiple
projections.

[![CompositeView pipeline](../api/current/assets/views/compositeview_pipeline.png "CompositeView pipeline")](../api/current/assets/views/compositeview_pipeline.png)

A CompositeView can define several sources of data of different types:

* ProjectEventStream: the event log of the project where the CompositeView is defined
* CrossProjectEventStream: the event log of an arbitrary project within the same Nexus deployment
* RemoteProjectEventStream: the event log of an arbitrary project within a different Nexus deployment

The sources are consumed as a collection of event streams, either from the primary store or via Server Sent Events in
the case of the RemoteProjectEventStream. Each event is either exchanged with the resource for which it was emitted
or dropped (if the filters defined in the originating source exclude it). The resource is then transformed into an
RDF graph and stored in a temporary namespace of BlazeGraph.

Projections are then executed by querying the temporary namespace via the `SPARQL CONSTRUCT` queries defined as part of
their configuration. These queries allow constructing an arbitrary RDF graph by traversing the temporary one starting
from the IRI node representing the originating resource id (the system recognizes the `{resource_id}` token in the
provided query and replaces it with the corresponding value).

CompositeViews allow defining multiple projections; the current supported types are:

* ElasticSearchProjection: data is projected as documents in an ElasticSearch index
* SparqlProjection: data is projected as an RDF named graph in a BlazeGraph namespace

Projections include filtering configuration to allow resources of different types or constrained by different schemas to
be indexed separately. An obvious use case is to index resources of different shapes in different ElasticSearch indices
with appropriate mapping definitions for each variation.

The complete configuration options can be found in the @ref:[api reference](../api/current/kg/views/composite-view-api.md).

## Studio

## View offsets

Views now expose `offset` as a sub-resource allowing the retrieval of the last consumed event id. The event id values
are the same as the ones presented via @ref:[Server Sent Events](../api/current/kg/kg-resources-api.md#resources-server-sent-events).

```
GET /v1/views/{org_label}/{project_label}/{view_id}/offset
```

An example response:

```json
{
    "@context": "https://bluebrain.github.io/nexus/contexts/offset.json",
    "@type": "TimeBasedOffset",
    "instant": "2020-02-14T09:31:41.400Z",
    "value": "ceaf0580-4f0c-11ea-98d9-dff6b2cf55b4"
}
```

Deleting the `offset` sub-resource instructs the system to rebuild the corresponding index by restarting the event
replay and indexing process.

```
DELETE /v1/views/{org_label}/{project_label}/{view_id}/offset
```

The system acknowledges the command by providing a `NoOffset` response:

```json
{
    "@context": "https://bluebrain.github.io/nexus/contexts/offset.json",
    "@type": "NoOffset"
}
```

## Other changes

The SparqlViews can now also @ref:[be queried](../api/current/kg/views/sparql-view-api.md#sparql-query) using the GET
HTTP method by providing the query string in the `query` parameter:

```
GET /v1/views/{org_label}/{project_label}/{view_id}/sparql?query={query}
```

Additional reported issues were [fixed](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av1.3.0+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug).
