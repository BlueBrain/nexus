# v1.2 To v1.3 Migration

As part of the v1.3 release @ref:[CompositeViews](../api/current/kg/views/composite-view-api.md) were introduced
requiring a change in the data model used to record the indexing progress of a View. The change is not backwards
compatible, it requires dropping two Cassandra tables and a rebuilding all indices.

The migration steps are as follows:

1. Stop the 3 services: iam, admin and kg.
2. [Backup](https://docs.datastax.com/en/archived/cassandra/3.0/cassandra/operations/opsBackupRestore.html) the
     cassandra store.
3. Delete all ElasticSearch indices:

        curl -XDELETE 'http://{elasticsearch_host}/kg_*'

4. Delete all BlazeGraph namespaces:

        for i in `curl -s 'http://{blazegraph_host}/blazegraph/namespace?describe-each-named-graph=false' | grep sparqlEndpoint | grep -o --color "rdf:resource=\"[^\"]*" | sed 's/rdf:resource="//' | sed 's#/sparql$##' | grep -v kb | grep -v LBS`
           do curl -X DELETE "$i"
        done

5. Drop the `kg.projections_progress` and the `kg.projections_failures` tables:

        drop table kg.projections_progress;
        drop table kg.projections_failures;

6. Deploy the new service images (tag `1.3`): [iam](https://hub.docker.com/r/bluebrain/nexus-iam),
      [admin](https://hub.docker.com/r/bluebrain/nexus-admin) and [kg](https://hub.docker.com/r/bluebrain/nexus-kg);
      make sure to start the iam, admin and kg services one by one in order.

Once the services are restarted with the new images all ElasticSearch and BlazeGraph indices will be rebuilt
automatically. The progress for each view can be tracked either in Nexus Web or using the
@ref:[statistics endpoint](../api/current/kg/views/elasticsearch-view-api.md#fetch-statistics) for each view:

        GET /v1/views/{org_label}/{project_label}/{view_id}/statistics
