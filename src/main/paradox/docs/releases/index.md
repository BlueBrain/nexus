## v1.0 (25.01.2019)

This is the first major release of Blue Brain Nexus after almost two years of development.

Also referred to as "_Nexus V1_", this initial release is our first big milestone in our quest to build a Knowledge
Graph platform uniquely combining flexible graph database, powerful search engine and scalable data store to enable:

*   Easy unification and integration of fragmented and disparate data from heterogeneous domains to break data and
    metadata silos
*   Better data governance with the ability to specify and enforce organizationâ€™s best practices for data collection,
    storage and description through high quality metadata
*   Data lineage and provenance recording and description
*   FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable) data and metadata management
